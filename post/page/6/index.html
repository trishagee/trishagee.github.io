    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      My recent slow-down in posting is because I've been trying to write a post explaining memory barriersand their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martinand Mikequestions trying to clarify some point, I just don't intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don't have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don't really get, I'm going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.

      We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it's even Martin's blog title. It's about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it's the next thing I thought I would tackle.

      Martin Fowler has written a really good articledescribing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&quot;.I'm working up to answering that. I'm currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&quot;.These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can't talk about why it's fast without saying what it does, and I can't talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I've covered the ring bufferitself, readingfrom it and writingto it.Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I've talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We'vedone some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

      The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor patterndeveloped at LMAX.After the last postwe all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you're using the Disruptor.ConsumerBarriers and ConsumersI'm going to approach this slightly backwards, because it's probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we've realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We've come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.On the site you can download a technical articleexplaining what the Disruptor is and why it's so clever and fast.

Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.

      Living and working in central London, you quickly learn that the fastest way around town is to cycle.My extensive research into this activity has shown there are a number of different cycling tribes.

      I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading.

For example, I popped into JAXthis week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&lt;gross-generalisation&gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.

      First, an apology. I will be using the British spelling for &ldquo;centre&rdquo;, because, well, I'm British. But it gets really confusing because you have to use the American spelling in the code. And doesn't &ldquo;Centring&rdquo; just look wrong?Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical CentringOne of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it. In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn't.

      Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I've had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.The Kitchen Is Not For Eating InSince eating and drinking is unfortunately a fundamental part of being human and staying alive, you will need to provide your staff with a space that pretends to address these needs.

      The last two weeks, actual work has conspired to keep me away from the blog. How rude. I miss &ldquo;the beach&rdquo; already.It seems only fair to summarise the lessons I have learnt whilst masquerading as an architect on a short consulting stint with Marc McNeill. Simon Brown at Coding the Architectureis much better at talking about this stuff than I am, but I need to update the blog with something!1.

      One of the aims of this series is to highlight some stupid gotchas in support for CSS in the different browsers.Today's gotcha is table borders.Yes, yes, I said don't use tables. What I means is, don't use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data. Like, for examples, lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices.But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&hellip; eccentric&hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.

      Because I was missing coding, and because my friend and I had an awesome phone app idea at the weekend, I thought I'd try my hand at developing an Android application this week.I want to give a quick overview of my preliminary thoughts on getting started on this endeavour. Background: I've got more than 10 years Java experience, but any UI for the applications I've worked on was always a web UI.

      Gah!! This is exactlywhat I was talking about- it's pink, it mentions shoes, and it's about as patronising as you can get.Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Linus Torvalds? I bet for a start it wouldn't mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags. And it probably wouldn't be in baby blue either.Which leads me nicely onto the next subject I have strong opinions on: Role models.

      At LMAXwe adopted Google Web Toolkitpretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.

      I'm a Java Developer. But I'm also a Web Developer. Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this. There's some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren't real programmers. Similarly, &ldquo;real&rdquo; developers don't like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &ldquo;front end stuff&rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.
