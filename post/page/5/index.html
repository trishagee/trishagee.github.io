      Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast (Update 2020: apparently no longer available), again to talk about all-female events. It&rsquo;s only a short one and there&rsquo;s probably not much in there that I haven&rsquo;t said before, either on here or in person.
From the 21st May, I&rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.

      This week&rsquo;s BBC Outriders podcast features yours truly venting about The Subject That Won&rsquo;t Go Away, Women in Technology. I was interviewed at Sunday&rsquo;s Girl Geek conference, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again. For those who can&rsquo;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:
 There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&rsquo;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.

It&rsquo;s basically a summary of the stuff I&rsquo;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.

      <p>Last week I went to get my hair cut (yes, sorry, this is a story about hair). I had thought long and hard about what I wanted. I researched, checked styles online, and bought a magazine so I could show my hairdresser exactly what I was after and there would be no confusion. I was determined I would not be spending that ridiculous amount of money on something I was not going to be happy with. I was even bold enough to ask for some changes to it at the end, which I have never ever had the courage to do before.</p>

<p>I was putting up the Christmas decorations one Saturday when my worst fear was realised<sup>1</sup> - one of my three strings of lights was not working.</p>
<p>The first two went up fine. The third lit up when I plugged it in, and in less than a second went out. Curses. This is not what I wanted, this was supposed to be a short exercise in making my tiny little flat look festive.</p>
<p>So I set about the tedious task of starting from the end closest to the plug and replacing every bulb, one by one, with a spare one to see if it magically lit up again. When it doesn&rsquo;t, you take the spare back out and replace it with the original bulb. I remember my parents going through this ritual every Christmas, the tediousness of this activity is more memorable than the fleeting joy of shinies.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back from Devoxx, having had lots of food for thought. In particular, my panel on <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Why+We+Shouldn%27t+Target+Women">Why We Shouldn&rsquo;t Target Women</a> generated a lot of discussion and I&rsquo;m still trying to process it all.</p>

<p>The panel went really well, we got decent interaction from the audience, and of course my fellow panel members were awesome. I managed to restrain myself from using the opportunity as my own personal soap box and allowed other people to speak occasionally. Sadly the only male on the panel stole the show somewhat, so Antonio won&rsquo;t be invited in future&hellip; Actually in seriousness, it was great to have a guy on the panel to present his point of view. It was interesting that he&rsquo;s a father, highlighting that parenting issues are not the same as women&rsquo;s issues, and conflating those two concerns hurts both genders. But Antonio&rsquo;s hair is far too shiny and pretty and he&rsquo;s funnier than I am, so I&rsquo;m not standing next to him again.</p>

 European conferences are different (and cool) because you get to hear even more languages spoken than you usually do in London (apparently the most diverse city in the world for spoken languages). I think the idea of a Paris Devoxx with 75% of the talks in French is brilliant - I&rsquo;m always banging on about diversity, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect developers to learn in English only.

      <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was at <a href="http://jaxlondon.com/">JAX London</a> along with a number of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/">London Java Community</a> regulars (<a href="http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/">Martijn</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kittylyst">Ben</a>/<a href="http://jr0cket.com/">John</a>/<a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/members/5737653/">Sandro</a>/<a href="http://devangelist.blogspot.com/">Simon</a>/<a href="http://zoah.co.uk/jax-london">Zoe</a> I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)</p>

<p>My purpose for attending was largely to present the <a href="https://trishagee.com/2011/10/21/mike_and_i_debut_our_new_disruptor_presentation/">Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners</a> talk that <a href="http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/">Mike</a> and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities. Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to be wrong.</p>

Kim eloquently describes what her situation is as Product Manager and the criteria she&rsquo;s measuring third party products against. I explain how LMAX aims to be the fastest retail exchange in the world, and therefore low latency is a tiny bit important to us.

      It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late. But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.
But before I move on, it&rsquo;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.
1) Martin Thompson and I are interviewed about the Disruptor winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):

<p>This Makes Me Sad. I had a really positive experience at JavaOne. In fact, I would say it was the one conference I&rsquo;ve been to in the last 12 months where I felt like my gender <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> a problem - I even got away with wearing hotpants (tweed is business-casual, right??) without being mistaken for anything other than a developer.</p>

<p>My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my <a href="https://trishagee.com/2011/10/04/javaone_initial_observations/">last post</a>):</p>

This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&rsquo;ll be there with Martin (of the Disruptor fame), and Martijn (that&rsquo;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJC he&rsquo;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committee role.
I&rsquo;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&rsquo;ll talk to me.

Well, I chased down the video, because I&rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&rsquo;t see me.

      <p>As a survival trait for living and working in the cites<sup>1</sup> of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers.  If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is.  Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.</p>
<p>So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.  I&rsquo;ll let you into a secret and tell you my nightly ritual:</p>

Just because my pictures are pretty awesome doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no opportunity for continuous learning.</p>
<p>The points Simon made in the session really made sense to me, and I wish I could have had something like that as a primer when they taught us UML at university. Without the context of what the diagrams were supposed to mean, to convey, all the boxes and lines made no sense to me back then. I&rsquo;m still not a fan of large chunks of UML because I think the convention sometimes gets in the way of real meaning.</p>
