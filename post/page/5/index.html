      Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast, again to talk about all-female events. It&rsquo;s only a short one and there&rsquo;s probably not much in there that I haven&rsquo;t said before, either on here or in person.
From the 21st May, I&rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.

      This week&rsquo;s BBC Outriders podcast features yours truly venting about The Subject That Won&rsquo;t Go Away, Women in Technology. I was interviewed at Sunday&rsquo;s Girl Geek conference, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again. For those who can&rsquo;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:
There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&rsquo;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.

      Google Campus is an awesome spaceToday I was at the Girl Geek Meetup conference. &nbsp;I didn't advertise it much because I've said in the past I don't really agree with women-only events, and actually I felt quite uncomfortable telling you guys I was going to be there, knowing the majority of my readers weren't allowed to attend.
It's probably worth explaining why I went, so a) I can give you guys and excuse but b) conference organisers can see what people like me are looking for in a conference.

      After attending a number of conferences and events, and performing numerous interviews, I&rsquo;m starting to hear the same things again and again. Since Dan North challenged all my assumptions at QCon, I&rsquo;m reluctant to outright ridicule them, but I will put forward my personal opinion.
Note: these are things I have heard from multiple sources, so with any luck I am not breaking the sanctity of the confessional interview.

      Last week I went to get my hair cut (yes, sorry, this is a story about hair). I had thought long and hard about what I wanted. I researched, checked styles online, and bought a magazine so I could show my hairdresser exactly what I was after and there would be no confusion. I was determined I would not be spending that ridiculous amount of money on something I was not going to be happy with.

      A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)
My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

Kim eloquently describes what her situation is as Product Manager and the criteria she&rsquo;s measuring third party products against. I explain how LMAX aims to be the fastest retail exchange in the world, and therefore low latency is a tiny bit important to us.

      It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late. But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.
But before I move on, it&rsquo;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.
1) Martin Thompson and I are interviewed about the Disruptor winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):

      I discovered, through the power of the search words that lead to my blog, that there was an incident at JavaOne that once again opens the can of worms that is Sexism In IT.
This Makes Me Sad. I had a really positive experience at JavaOne. In fact, I would say it was the one conference I&rsquo;ve been to in the last 12 months where I felt like my gender wasn&rsquo;t a problem - I even got away with wearing hotpants (tweed is business-casual, right?

A video of the session is available, as are the slides. I promise not to say &ldquo;so&rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?

      Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.
My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):
First and foremost, the people. I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. Makes me feel better about the presentations I&rsquo;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchess girls; other Duke Award winners; the Azul guys; guys (well, girls) from O&rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.

This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&rsquo;ll be there with Martin (of the Disruptor fame), and Martijn (that&rsquo;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJC he&rsquo;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committee role.
I&rsquo;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&rsquo;ll talk to me.

Well, I chased down the video, because I&rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&rsquo;t see me.

      As a survival trait for living and working in the cites1 of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers. If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is. Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.
So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.

      On Thursday I was at Simon Brown&rsquo;s Effective Sketches session at Skillsmatter. Just because my pictures are pretty awesome doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no opportunity for continuous learning.
The points Simon made in the session really made sense to me, and I wish I could have had something like that as a primer when they taught us UML at university. Without the context of what the diagrams were supposed to mean, to convey, all the boxes and lines made no sense to me back then.

      Martin recently announced version 2.0 of the Disruptor - basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&rsquo;s time to mark that officially. His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&rsquo;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again. Now I see the disadvantage of hand-drawing everything.
