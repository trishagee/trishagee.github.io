      I have not (yet) seen the presentation this post is referring to. But I think many of the comments Ted makes are very valid, and our industry as a whole should occasionally stop and think. I've seen Ted speak at QCon, and I've had a lot of time for his comments ever since.I'm aware that this blog is rapidly filling with comments about gender and perceptions and people-y stuff, when I originally wanted it to be a purely technical blog.

      Let's celebrate our IT women&quot;Everyone&quot; knows that there are more men than women in IT. That it's a &quot;boys&quot; job. Not a lot of people know that the first programmer was a woman. Not a lot of people realise the number of women in IT is DECREASING. And has been since the 80s. In a working world where I honestly believe that in general there are more opportunities for women (OK, inline with the other stuff I've been reading I'll caveat this with white, middle-class women), it seems shocking that such a growth industry as IT is actually losing women, and appears unable to determine why, or stop the flow.

      Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.I'd also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don't buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.

      I'm very interested in the subject of gender stereotyping, which probably isn't surprising as I'm a girl in a predominantly male industry. And I like cars, and sports, and get irritated if people assume I'm not &quot;allowed&quot; to be interested in these things.Far from being discriminated against, however, I find many people ask me why there aren't more women in the industry and what can be done to encourage girls into IT.

      I'm reading Joel Spolsky's User Interface Design for Programmers. A thought that's struck me is about architecture. It's easy to get fooled into thinking building software is a bit like being the architect for a building. I'm not even going to go into the differences between engineering practices à la building design and good practice software design. I'm going to start from the easy point, the stuff you can see. There's often a pressure from your designers, from your steering committee, even from your CEO, to make your software look &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;.

      After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented – they agreed to send me to the US.To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.

      Thisis a great example of what happens when you try to incentivise intelligent people on very simple metrics.They cheat.This was well described in Freakonomics, and something Mr On Softwarebangs on about regularly. It's clear that there isn't really a good answer to the problem - actually that's not true. The answer to the problem is to have everyone working in a job they are happy in and proud of, one where they are intrinsically motivated, and give them enough information to allow them to make the correct calls when it comes to prioritising work.

      Hmm. I have been so busy trying to think of &ldquo;good&rdquo; things to write here, and not having the time to actually write, that I see it's been 6 months since the last post.If anyone is still out there though, I need help. I need a good Certified Scrum Master course in New York or London, preferably in April or May. Any suggestions? The one I wanted to go on was vetoed and now I find it's not running in NY again until Autumn.

      So if java generics slightly disappointed me lately, what have I found cool?I'm currently working on a web application using Spring MVC, which probably doesn't come as a big surprise, it seems to be all the rage these days. Since this is my baby, I got to call the shots as to a lot of the framework choices. When it came to looking at implementing validation, I refused to believe I'd have to go through the primitive process of looking at all the values on the request and deciding if they pass muster, with some huge ifstatement.

      When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought genericswere the best thing since sliced bread. No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the new for loop, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.Consider the old code:List list = new ArrayList();list.add(new Integer(1));Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0);for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {Integer number = (Integer)i.next();number.intValue();}And the new:List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();list.

      Isn't a shame that actual day-to-day work always seems to get in the way of progress? How you're always too busy fire-fighting to actually perform the critical thing that might actually improve affairs.All this is basically a setup for a roundabout excuse for why this blog has been neglected so shortly after it was begun. I was a bit too busy doing the day job.Still, people like Joeland Scottmanage regular pronouncements and I'm sure they're much busier than I!

      This is a bloody good idea.
It builds upon my own Virgoen tendancies to write lists and tick things off, but what the list model lacks is the &ldquo;in progress&rdquo; state. Plus occasionally my lists get confused.

      &hellip;there are a number of points in this interviewwith Paul Oldfield which are interesting to consider when thinking about &ldquo;doing Agile right&rdquo;. It seems to be compatible with my &ldquo;people over process&rdquo; view - I'm not stating that having good people negates the need for any form of process or discipline, I have seen that this is simply not the case. I do however think that agile techniques in particular rely heavily upon the &ldquo;right&rdquo; people / team, for some nebulous definition of &ldquo;right&rdquo;.
