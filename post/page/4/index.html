        My First Official MongoDB Appearance

      Yesterday I had the nerve-wracking dubious alarming great pleasure of presenting my first official MongoDB-shaped talk. This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.
I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

      Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and got me excited about the prospects for 2013.
The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.

This is my brain

During the normal course of my life, it&rsquo;s filled with Stuff.


Early in November, 10gen ordered me to go to New York to learn about MongoDB (Oh No! My Life Is So Hard!). I was looking forward to shopping and taking photos of the devastation wrought by Sandy, but actually I spent the whole time drinking from the firehose of MongoDB information provided by my ridiculously smart, ridiculously well-informed colleagues.

I&rsquo;m learning a lot about these new-fangled NoSQL database thingies. The LMAX architecture was based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path.

      Seemed like a quiet conference this year. Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.
Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&rsquo;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:

It&rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne.

It&rsquo;s a very geeky conference. I mean that as a compliment, of course. Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&rsquo;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.

      On Sunday I gave my very first workshop on the Disruptor. The aim was to give people some hands-on coding experience using the syntax. Because time was limited (you can&rsquo;t get people to build an entire application architecture in 2.5 hours) the example is somewhat contrived, and needs a big leap to make it into a proper application context. But the workshop should:
Give an overview of the DisruptorShow how to create a simple one producer, one consumer example.

      So yeah&hellip; in keeping with this year&rsquo;s theme of basically only blogging about the exciting conferences I&rsquo;ve been to, I&rsquo;m going to blog about the exciting conferences I am attending in the future. I haven&rsquo;t been great at doing that, the disconnect between the time I submit a presentation and the actual announcement means that I often forget I haven&rsquo;t told anyone about what I&rsquo;m up to.
Firstly, I&rsquo;m back in the States this month to present my very first workshop - An Introduction to the Disruptor at Strangeloop.

I have to say that when Ben and Martijn told me I had to do OSCON, that it was one of the conferences to go to, I was sceptical - not because I thought it would be rubbish, but because I have enjoyed all the conferences I&rsquo;ve been to for different reasons.
But I&rsquo;m really impressed so far.
The program is packed with great topics and speakers, and so many things I want to see that clash with each other.

      I&rsquo;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming. Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) sigh.The problem with these sessions is that you&rsquo;re preaching to the choir. Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause. People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&rsquo;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.

      Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don&rsquo;t Think I Agree With.
To developers technologies are everything
I can&rsquo;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.
Is this true?
It&rsquo;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.

      Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new community of developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.
It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

      Three airports and three hotels in a week, and I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m coming or going. Add to that a mere four hours sleep last night, and this might resemble the ramblings of a mad woman (more than usual that is).
GOTO Amsterdam was a different affair to GOTO Copenhagen, which is not necessarily a bad thing - it&rsquo;s great that the events have their own personalities and aren&rsquo;t cookie cutter versions of the same thing.

It was my first conference "alone", in that I didn't have friends and colleagues from LMAX or the London Java Community there with me. &nbsp;And certainly at the start of the conference, I wasn't the only one who was standing around, hoping someone would talk to me (in all honesty some of the photos above are a little unfair - the schedule was a very nice, simple phone app so most people spent a lot of time playing with their phones).
