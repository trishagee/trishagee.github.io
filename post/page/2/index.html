      For the rest of 2013, this blog will mostly be masquerading as a travel blog.This week I've been in Oslo, and I liked it.&nbsp; Actually, you'll be hard-pushed to find somewhere I've visited that I didn't like in one way or another, but Oslo does make my "definitely going back there" list.&nbsp; If Seville, where I've been for the last month, is stuffed full of History, Oslo is overflowing with Geography.

      The second in my short series of blogs about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. &nbsp;In it, there&rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &ldquo;classic&rdquo; API, or a blend of both.
The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. &nbsp;Sorry Maven.
If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.

        Interviewed by Stephen Chin about JavaOne 2013

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&rsquo;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.
It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.

      InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&rsquo;s going through the interviewer&rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.

      I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I&rsquo;ve written a blog post for Somewhere Else. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve written about the design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&rsquo;m just linking you to them instead.
Anyone who&rsquo;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.

      I was expecting this&hellip;So, I was in China last week. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not really what I expected, but then my knowledge of China comes almost entirely from visiting various Chinatowns and watching martial arts movies, so I guess I wasn&rsquo;t all that well prepared for a modern Asian city like Shanghai.
&hellip;and found this insteadThe city is, in my opinion, clean, modern, and attractive. &nbsp;I was surprised by American-looking early skyscrapers, and really surprised that the city overall felt more European than American - with Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, Carrefour, H &amp; M, Zara, Costa Coffee, as well as the inevitable McDonalds, KFC and Pizza Hut.

      Inspired by Your App Makes Me Fat, I was going to write a blog post about decision fatigue. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a topic very close to my heart right now as I try to plan for my upcoming speaking engagements,&nbsp;continue working on the new Java driver, try to finish the last couple of blogs on Spock, and last but not least plan for moving home this week.
But since my cognitive resources are at a low point right now, I&rsquo;ll just leave you with a gif instead:
