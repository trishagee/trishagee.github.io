      This year I&rsquo;ve been demonstrating how easy it is to create modern web apps using AngularJS, Java and MongoDB. I also use Groovy during this demo to do the sorts of things Groovy is really good at - writing descriptive tests, and creating scripts.
Due to the time pressures in the demo, I never really get a chance to go into the details of the script I use, so the aim of this long-overdue blog post is to go over this Groovy script in a bit more detail.

developer.</p>
<p>I sought to rectify this with a couple of blog posts for the MongoDB official blog: the first, an introduction to using MongoDB from 
Java, including a non-comprehensive list of some of the libraries you can use; the second, an introductory guide to simple CRUD 
operations using the Java driver:</p>

      So, following on from my observations of being an outsider at FOSDEM because I&rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.
I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.

      So, FOSDEM.I've heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to goThe Java dev roomNow I know people talk about impostor syndrome whenever they mention the woeful lack of diversity at tech conferences.&nbsp; Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I'm a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I'm not an open source person.

      Last night was the inaugural meeting of the Sevilla MongoDN User Group. &nbsp;An event organised with just over 48 hours notice, in a city where I don't speak the language and where even my best-connected contacts aren't sure they're fully plugged in to the tech scene.
I'll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I'm desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I'm just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?

 I&rsquo;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&rsquo;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.

      So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blog than a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&rsquo;d been to.

So, JavaOne, again, my third year there.

      I'm a great believer in getting kids to code early - after all, I'm of that generation that was taught&nbsp; at the age of 9.&nbsp; There are quite a few approaches to teaching today's kids in an engaging way, but I'm a bit wary of the sandbox solutions that teach kids things like how to navigate a virtual thingie around the screen, or lets them create things in a limited virtual world.
