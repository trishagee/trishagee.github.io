      In the last post I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spock as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.
As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.
Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. &nbsp;Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. &nbsp;At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

      One of the most obvious differences I faced when I moved from LMAX to 10gen were the working conditions. I don't mean like being deep underground in some dangerous situation vs being pampered by beautiful slave boys and girls. What I mean is that the working practices at one company necessitated being in the office for core hours, and at the other flexible hours and remote-working are practically mandatory. At at LMAX we pair-programmed most days, and that meant that being co-located: being in the same office, at the same computer, was pretty important.

      Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.
Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&rsquo;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&rsquo;t do half as much as some people).

      Don&rsquo;t you hate it when you ask a perfectly good question, and someone comes back with the answer &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;?
It&rsquo;s so frustrating to think that in a world of ones and zeros, people can&rsquo;t give absolute answers and you can&rsquo;t rely on &ldquo;best practice&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s an answer I&rsquo;ve given so many times, especially when someone asks about performance. &nbsp;Well, I&rsquo;ve had my&nbsp;comeuppance. &nbsp;The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for MongoDB has been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;:

Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve been involved in planning QCon this year. &nbsp;So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&rsquo;ve helped build.

I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. &nbsp;For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.
