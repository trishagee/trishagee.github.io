      <p>Right so yes. 2020, hello. One of my 2020 resolutions is to get back to my personal blog. Weekly. Yeah right. Let&rsquo;s
aim for weekly and be happy with monthly.</p>
<p>For my first post let&rsquo;s do the obligatory look-back-over-last-year. Not because it&rsquo;s trendy (I&rsquo;m 41 now, I don&rsquo;t care about being trendy any more), but because it&rsquo;s super important for me to understand what I went through and what I achieved last year (every year), otherwise I get caught up in the hamster-wheel of the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing. Progress should be celebrated, not just ignored for the next item on the ever growing, ever pressing TODO list. Also, looking back helps me to plan the next year. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be super-planned, but setting some goals, objectives, ideas for which direction I&rsquo;d prefer to go in helps me decide how to prioritise that ever-growing, ever-pressing TODO list.</p>

<p>As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find bugs and security issues early</li>
<li>Improve the readability of our code</li>
<li>Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.</p>
<p>Here is a quick guide to help you to create an effective code review process.</p>

      <p>For years I&rsquo;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&rsquo;t want to cover it because I
didn&rsquo;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&rsquo;t want other
women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&rsquo;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking
long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&rsquo;s not how everyone works.</p>

        What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

<p>So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&rsquo;s involved in the
job, what&rsquo;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&rsquo;s it like
working remotely etc etc.  Given I also rather generously<sup>1</sup> recently offered to answer
people&rsquo;s questions about my job, I thought the most scalable way was to write-once-read-many,

found I was attending conferences as a speaker &ldquo;on the circuit&rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting
to other attendees to see what they&rsquo;re up to and so forth, didn&rsquo;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out

As part of this, we&rsquo;re running <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/">three sessions</a> during the course so we can, as a group, ask  questions about the lectures, get help with the homework, and (if we&rsquo;re feeling very smart!) help people who may be struggling (or might not have watched the videos).</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Day three of my <a href="/post/new_year_new_adventures">brand new job</a> - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&rsquo;m
already a &ldquo;Power User&rdquo;, to see if there&rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, <em>really</em> read it.  Of course, I&rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&rsquo;t previously known,
and they&rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&rsquo;t know was possible.</p>

      Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &ldquo;the MongoDB people&rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.

      Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&rsquo;t post it now I&rsquo;ll never post it, and it&rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.
