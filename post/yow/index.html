It looked at each of the SOLID principles, where they came from, what they are, helped us understand why we need to care about them (or not).  It became clear to me that as we become more experienced, as we grow, we need to continually re-visit the things we think we know, or the basics of what we&rsquo;re trying to do, as you&rsquo;ll find things there that surprise you - things you thought you understood, or things that you didn&rsquo;t understand before and now have more context for.  In particular, I learnt another argument against using inheritance willy-nilly (one of my current favourite bug-bears)</div><ul><li>Writing software is like writing fiction.</li><li>Experts say &ldquo;it depends&rdquo; because they know a number of rules which might be applicable.</li><li>You can&rsquo;t change <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html">published interfaces</a> because other people are dependent upon your code (pretty much the entire basis of my Backwards Compatibility talk), but if you own the code you can change it to your heart&rsquo;s content.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f116466b93322f4900000f?track=Service+%2F+API+Design&amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au">Creating Observable APIs with Rx</a></div><div>Ben Christensen (<a href="http://twitter.com/benjchristensen">@benjchristensen</a>)</div><div><br /></div><div>Netflix are doing some really amazing stuff with architecture, design and code, and what I love the most is that they&rsquo;re willing to share it with the rest of us.

at the <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/lean-software-and-systems-conference.html">Lean conference at Bletchley in 2010</a>.  In this talk I was struck once again how important the words we use are: should, given/when/then, and so on, giving us a framework for thinking about a problem.  It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/spock">move towards Spock</a>, because it forces the use of some of these words.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wrote lots of notes:</div><div><ul><li>Assume you got it wrong</li><li>Is there a context in which the event will create a different outcome? (Your account is empty, the ATM is out of cash, you have a pre-approved overdraft)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t think of the software that will solve the problem, assume it will be done by pixies (like <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Iconograph">Pratchett&rsquo;s Iconograph</a>), forcing us to stop thinking of solutions when we&rsquo;re trying to outline the problem.</li><li>Not all user stories are about the user, they might be about other stakeholders</li><li>Acceptance criteria vs scenarios - &ldquo;Can you give me an example?&ldquo;</li><li>Ask why a change needs to be made or why something is a bug, if I&rsquo;ve messed up this feature I might have messed up something else</li><li>Testers do think differently to developers, they have a process of deliberate discovery</li><li>BA/Dev/Tester huddle - the three amigos</li><li>If a project has no risks, don&rsquo;t do it</li><li>Complicated/Complex/Chaotic/Simple projects/systems.  Some types of systems don&rsquo;t lend themselves well to BDD</li><li>All the risk is in Complex problems, and this is also likely where the value is.  This is the area that developers tend to like to live.</li></ul></div><div>Afterwards I questioned Liz on her separation of Devs and Testers in the talk - this seems contra to the current trend of hiring developers-in-test or other moves to make QAs and developers one-team-one-dream.  She pointed out that it&rsquo;s less of a job description and more of a role that people take in a team.  Then she suggested I was currently in a tester role, not developer, as my mindset is very much focussed around proving our code quality rather than jumping in and implementing features.  I think it was meant as a positive thing&hellip;</div><div>       <div><br /></div><a href="https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f10bf536d9ddae2800000b?track=Architecture+%26+Security&amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au">Practical Considerations For Microservice Architectures</a></div><div>Sam Newman (<a href="http://twitter.com/samnewman">@samnewman</a>)</div><div><br /></div><div>&quot;Microservices&rdquo;

and a more MongoDB-focussed one, which I reused the original title for.  This newer, MongoDB-focussed one is what I gave at GOTO Berlin, and I decided to use this for YOW as it&rsquo;s a technical (ish) talk that goes into some detail about MongoDB, and they do pay my rent.</div><div><br /></div><div>The really great (or possibly, bad) thing about YOW is that because it&rsquo;s the same conference at three venues, only a few days apart, it gives you a chance to put your Lean Startup knowledge into practice - you can experiment, get feedback, and improve.  Like the GOTOs/QCons, they have a Green/Yellow/Red feedback system from the audience so you can get a feel for how they liked your talk (the Aussies are a bit non-committal, they were keen on the Yellow button - commit one way or another!! (or don&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t want more reds)).  So decided to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B test</a> my talk - at Melbourne, I gave the GOTO Berlin one; at Brisbane, the original one with updated code and design diagrams.  Since the Brisbane one got a higher score, I went with that with some minor tweaks for Sydney.  The upshot is, people like hand-drawn pictures of monsters, and are less keen on understanding the internals of MongoDB.  That&rsquo;s useful to know.</div><div><br /></div><div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />But the talks aren&rsquo;t the only things that make a conference.  And YOW got the other stuff right too:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s1600/1Catamaran.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s320/1Catamaran.jpg" width="265" /></a><li>I loved the drinks receptions in the evenings, that&rsquo;s a great place for people to come and ask you questions about your talk, stuff they might not want to share in front of everyone.  Note to attendees - if you do see a speaker at a drinks/network/mingle event, feel free to chat to them.  We&rsquo;re there for you guys, and we&rsquo;re only people ourselves and like the company.  At many events, the speakers know very few people.</li><li>Sydney had an outdoor eating area, which was awesome - if you&rsquo;re going to spend weeks in a conference hall, it&rsquo;s nice to get outside for food.</li><li>There was a, um, misunderstanding about appropriate dress code for one of the vendors.  The conference organisers were on this immediately, and, to their credit, the vendor acted swiftly with no fuss.  A great example of how to handle this sort of thing at tech conferences.</li><li>Having all the travel and accommodation, particularly for this complicated trip, arranged by very capable and approachable people made the speakers&rsquo; lives really easy, and I think that helped us to be more prepared and relaxed for our talks.</li><li>A speaker&rsquo;s excursion (on a boat!) at the weekend was an amazing way to bond with the other guys.</li></ul><div>I loved YOW, I hope I can go again.</div></div></div></div></p>
