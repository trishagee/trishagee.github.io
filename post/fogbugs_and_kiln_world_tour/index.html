    <main class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Last Thursday I was fortunate enough to get a place on the <a href="http://worldtour.fogcreek.com/">FogBugz and Kiln World Tour</a>. &nbsp;I booked it before I moved jobs, and I&rsquo;ll be honest I had no real interest in the software. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been reading Joel&rsquo;s books and blogs since my friend Brent bought me <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590593898">Joel on Software</a>&nbsp;and made me read it (he had the foresight to know I&rsquo;d want to hang on to his copy if he&rsquo;d lent it to me!). &nbsp;I wanted to see the man in the flesh and hear what he had to say about his software. &nbsp;Because really, do we honestly need yet another bug-tracking / project-management tool?<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Who would benefit from FogBugz?</span><br /><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html">Joel</a>&rsquo;s demo was really good at demonstrating exactly how you might use the software - the processes you might follow, how to raise / update a ticket and chase it, and how you can see what&rsquo;s going on with the projects tracked.<br /><br />I can actually think of a number of companies I&rsquo;ve worked for, or friends have worked for, that would see an improvement in productivity from using <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/">FogBugz</a> for bug tracking / project management. &nbsp;When I worked at Touch Clarity (later swallowed by <a href="http://www.omniture.com/">Omniture</a>, which was gobbled by <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>) I was desperately looking for a product to help us:<br /><ul><li>Record defects</li><li>Capture new feature requests</li><li>Assign tasks to developers</li><li>Estimate tasks</li><li>Track progress - both at a project level and for individual developers</li><li>Provide us with a lightweight process which was easy to follow</li><li>Generate reports for management.</li></ul><br /><div>From the demo I saw, FogBugz will do everything we wanted at that time. &nbsp;We were using <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> back then, and badly. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d also investigated <a href="http://www.xplanner.org/">XPlanner</a>, <a href="http://www.versionone.com/Product/Product_Planning.asp">VersionOne</a>&nbsp;and a bunch of other defect/project management tools, and not really seen anything that did what I wanted (certainly that was cheap enough). &nbsp;But this was back in <sup>2004</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, we were doing a half-hearted version of <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a>, and we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of cash to burn. &nbsp;It was hard then to find a lightweight, customisable, inexpensive tool.</div><div><br /></div><div>The things I saw in FogBugz that I thought would be useful were:</div><div><ul><li>Nice UI - usability of these things is so frequently under-valued.</li><li>Really easy to track what&rsquo;s going on with a defect, to add and edit comments etc. &nbsp;I actually liked that the edit feature still tracked versions of the comments, I can see how some organisations would need that audit trail.</li><li>Evidence-based scheduling - I liked the way that it uses past information to have a good guess at how accurate an estimate will be, and therefore the soonest, likely and latest times a feature might be delivered by.</li><li>Visibility over an individual developer&rsquo;s workload.</li><li>Visibility over work at a project-level</li><li>Loads of charts/reports to let you slice and dice the stuff you have in there.</li><li>Dependency management</li><li>Neat integration to source control - yes, I know you can get this for loads of management tools now, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not useful. It seemed pretty slick here.</li><li>It seemed quick. &nbsp;But then it could have been a locally-running instance with about 3 defects in it.</li></ul><br /></div>The things I thought would not be so useful in a more Agile environment:<br /><ul><li>Evidence-based scheduling</li><li>Visibility over an individual developer&rsquo;s workload.</li><li>Lots of the ways the data can be sliced and diced</li><li>Dependency management</li></ul><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">So, you like it and you don&rsquo;t like it?</span></div><div>Yeah yeah, I&rsquo;ve gone all multiple-personality again. &nbsp;The stuff I liked about the product would be dead useful for the types of projects that work that way - where you assign work to individual developers who estimate the work; where developers are assigned to specific projects; where stories / features might not be broken down into small, independent tasks. &nbsp;These places might be running waterfall, or some agile-ish process, or no process at all. &nbsp;A tool like this will give them much better visibility over what&rsquo;s going on, over which deadlines won&rsquo;t be met, over who&rsquo;s estimates are flaky and who&rsquo;s are generally reliable.<br /><br /></div><div>However even before I joined <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>, before I joined <a href="http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/about-lmax">LMAX</a>, I was sold on Agile as a more natural way to run development teams (this is despite having worked with Touch Clarity&rsquo;s sort-of-XP and A Very Large Media Organisation&rsquo;s <a href="http://bitsnwidgets.com/2008/04/19/DontBeASCRUMBUT.aspx">ScrumBut</a>). &nbsp;The problems that some of the features in FogBugz tries to address are similar to the problems that Agile (<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">XP</a>/<a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/learn_about_scrum">Scrum</a>/<a href="http://availagility.co.uk/2008/10/28/kanban-flow-and-cadence/">Kanban</a> or some hybrid of these) is also supposed to address.</div><div><ul><li>Evidence-based scheduling: I totally agree with getting statistical about this - teams and management should have a good idea how reliable estimates are. &nbsp;But one of the ways to reduce the variation is to have the estimates done by the team. &nbsp;At LMAX, we would have three developers estimate every story. &nbsp;With any luck at least one of those would know enough about it to provide some solid technical guidance on what was involved, but if there wasn&rsquo;t someone in a group of three that had that knowledge, chances were pretty good the team generally were going to be pretty vague on it. &nbsp;Granted, if you&rsquo;re using FogBugz you can enter the team estimate instead of just the individual who is going to implement it and then your evidence-based scheduling will be for team-estimates instead of personal ones. &nbsp;This is totally fine, in fact it&rsquo;s a good thing - I just think we shouldn&rsquo;t use evidence-based scheduling to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the problem that estimates are just that - an estimate, a guess.</li><li>Visibility over a developer&rsquo;s workload: If you&rsquo;re doing pair programming (XP), if the team takes ownership of the implementation of features / stories (Scrum), there&rsquo;s no need to look at how busy an individual developer is. &nbsp;Yes, there are lots of organisations that do allocate work to individuals. &nbsp;In many (most?) Agile-practicing teams, this will not be happening. &nbsp;So really you only need visibility over a team or project level.</li><li>Reporting: Ah, I love reporting. &nbsp;I love data, statistics, pretty charts. Maybe I&rsquo;m secretly a project manager. &nbsp;But it&rsquo;s SO easy to get hung up on the stats, on one tiny measurement, rather than the bigger picture - are we getting closer to &ldquo;done&rdquo; or not? &nbsp;I think you should be able to get at all that data, but not get carried away micro-optimising for metrics which may be hiding bigger problems.</li><li>Dependency management: another thing that is dead important in some types of teams or organisations. &nbsp;But the last few Agile projects I&rsquo;ve worked on have not tracked hard-link dependencies at all - each story should stand alone, should be estimated on the basis of just doing that piece of work. &nbsp;Yes, this is idealistic, and even in the projects where we did not officially track dependencies, we&rsquo;d have a good idea of a very general order things should be done in (or an idea of the order things could be done in to make life easier). &nbsp;But these things can be fluid, if a specific feature needs to be done now, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to do every single story that might have a tiny piece of functionality this story is dependent on - just tackle this story and everything you need for it. &nbsp;</li></ul><div>All of those points could be blog posts in their own right, I know it&rsquo;s taken me years to get my head around the way I personally see Agile. &nbsp;But you get the idea, or maybe you don&rsquo;t - that&rsquo;s fine, maybe you&rsquo;re in exactly the sort of place that could use FogBugz to improve your productivity.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">FogBugz vs Mingle</span></div><div>I started at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> last week, so I&rsquo;d better mention that <a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/">ThoughtWorks Studios</a> have a competitor product, <a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management">Mingle</a>. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m reasonably well-qualified to talk about it since I&rsquo;ve been using it in anger for the last two years in a maturing agile environment, and&nbsp;I had my Mingle&nbsp;<s>indoctrination</s>&nbsp;induction last week.</div><div><br /></div><div>To me, the main difference is the angle the two products are taking to approach the same problem: how do you provide a tool that</div><div><ol><li>is easy and lightweight enough to use that people (particularly developers) will keep it up to date;</li><li>tracks just the right amount of data that people have visibility over the state of development (What are we doing? &nbsp;Are we going to hit our deadlines? What are our blockers?)</li></ol><br /><div>To me, it seems FogBugz is coming from the traditional development model - it might not be anything as formal as waterfall, but it may not be based on short iterations and assumes individuals rather than teams are assigned work. &nbsp;Mingle was developed for the Agile team, e.g. collective responsibility, pair programming, short iterations.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Mingle is highly configurable, and while FogBugz has a number of templates and custom work flows, Mr Spolsky specifically stated at the demo that these really shouldn&rsquo;t be used. &nbsp;That they&rsquo;ve worked hard to find a process that works, and we should all follow that.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, Mingle embraces the differences between teams/processes and FogBugz specifically discourages it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I reckon these things are actually also the potential downfalls for both products too: &nbsp;Mingle can be abused so badly that it adds no value; FogBugz could be so prescriptive it slows down productivity.</div><div><br /></div><div>But it&rsquo;s horses for courses, every tool has its advantages and disadvantages. &nbsp;Or should I be pushing Mingle at this point until I pass my probation??</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Kiln, and an introduction to DVCS</span></div><div>Good Lord, I&rsquo;ve written all that stuff and that&rsquo;s only from the short demo at the start of the day.</div><div><br /></div><div>Fortunately I have a lot less to say about the latter part. &nbsp;It was an introduction to Distributed Version Control (DVCS), and it was pitched absolutely right for someone like me. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I&rsquo;ve never used a DVCS; most recently I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, but I&rsquo;ve also used <a href="http://pvcs.synergex.com/">PVCS</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/">ClearCase</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302175.aspx#vssmap_topic2">VSS</a>&nbsp;and a bunch of others (in fact, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve had to learn a new source control system every time I&rsquo;ve switched project or company!). &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been introduced to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>&nbsp;over a lunchtime, and I read Martin Fowler&rsquo;s blog post on <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VersionControlTools.html">version control tools</a>. &nbsp;The intro provided by FogCreek was spot on for me. &nbsp;It showed me:</div><div><ul><li>The differences between a DVCS and something like Subversion (OK, specifically svn, which is fine for me);</li><li>Advantages of using a distributed source control system;</li><li>Some mindsets that you need to change when switching from svn to a DVCS like <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>;</li><li>The FogCreek way of setting up the repositories.</li></ul><br /><div>The last point was particularly useful in giving some real-life examples of how to use a DVCS and why.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Then there was some stuff on why <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/">Kiln</a> might give you more than just the freebie Mercurial install.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was more useful in a general fashion than the FogBugz section. &nbsp;However, like the FogBugz talk, I got a good feel for the types of teams/companies Kiln might be good for, and why you might use it. &nbsp;Personally it convinced me that using a DVCS in general is probably better than Subversion (insert usual disclaimer of different tools being appropriate for different situations). &nbsp;It certainly encourages working practices that will lead to a) less accidental loss of code (after all, that&rsquo;s what source control is for) and b) if well organised, better separation of bugs / features / stories and better integration across versions and branches.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you want to know what I&rsquo;ve been blathering on about in this section, check out Joel&rsquo;s <a href="http://hginit.com/00.html">excellent introduction to Mercurial</a>. &nbsp;OK, I admit it, I haven&rsquo;t read it all. &nbsp;But it seems to cover everything that was covered in the conference session, with Joel&rsquo;s usual wit and appeal to the developer mindset.</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">In Other News</span></div><div>In terms of an education session, the &ldquo;World Tour&rdquo; was excellent - succinct, easy to digest, and (to my mind) aimed exactly at the audience.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>However</i>. &nbsp;I actually ended the (half) day being slightly disappointed, and not just because these tools don&rsquo;t seem to be ideal for the Agile team.&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>I didn&rsquo;t get enough of a chance to network. &nbsp;Now, I&rsquo;m happy to admit this is a problem I regularly have - because, like many developers, I find it difficult to talk to new people in a big room full of people I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;However, given that this was a big room full of developers, I wish there had been more of an effort made to help us to mix and network. Before the talks we were on tables in another room having coffee etc, which I liked because it did lead to some conversation in small groups. &nbsp;But I would have been nice if there had been a chance at the end of the talks to chat to people and&nbsp;dissect&nbsp;the session (if there actually was, it was so badly publicised I missed it). &nbsp;I went with a stack of business cards and didn&rsquo;t give a single one out.</li><li>The half day didn&rsquo;t seem like enough. &nbsp;But this might be more a reflection of the above point since I got what I wanted from the talks, any more would have been too much info. &nbsp;So maybe I just wanted more time with the attendees and with the FogCreek guys.</li><li>I was shocked by how few women there were. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m no tech newbie, I&rsquo;ve been to training sessions, conferences, user groups, seminars, and worked on site at a lot of different types of places. &nbsp;I was very surprised to see that in a room of several hundred people I counted 5 women (myself included). &nbsp;This seems low even for gathering of techies, it seems <i>very</i> low for a presentation on a piece of software that is effectively project management software. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have the stats to hand, but in my personal experience any technical event with even a sniff of project management stuff is better represented across both genders. &nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t normally comment on it because it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m used to myself, but I&rsquo;ve been asked a bunch of times in the last two weeks &ldquo;what do we need to do to encourage more participation by women?&rdquo;, and I have my eyes open for stuff which might help me answer that.</li></ul><br /><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">In Conclusion</span></div></div><div><ol><li>A generally good, well-run event, especially as it was free (if I recall correctly).</li><li><a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/">FogBugz</a> and <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/">Kiln</a> are excellent tools for a certain type of organisation / team, and I&rsquo;m not talking about a small minority of teams here.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re Agile, these tools are probably not for you. &nbsp;You can get them to work, and if you&rsquo;re &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; agile they&rsquo;re probably better than a lot of your options. &nbsp;But true agile teams running an effective process might find themselves hindered more than helped.</li><li>I&rsquo;m going to download and install a DVCS the very next time I have to write a line of code.</li></ol><br /><br /></div></p>
