    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Last Thursday I was fortunate enough to get a place on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz and Kiln World Tour<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I booked it before I moved jobs, and I'll be honest I had no real interest in the software.  I've been reading Joel's books and blogs since my friend Brent bought me <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joel on Software<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and made me read it (he had the foresight to know I'd want to hang on to his copy if he'd lent it to me!).  I wanted to see the man in the flesh and hear what he had to say about his software.  Because really, do we honestly need yet another bug-tracking / project-management tool?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who would benefit from FogBugz?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joel<!-- raw HTML omitted -->'s demo was really good at demonstrating exactly how you might use the software - the processes you might follow, how to raise / update a ticket and chase it, and how you can see what's going on with the projects tracked.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can actually think of a number of companies I've worked for, or friends have worked for, that would see an improvement in productivity from using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for bug tracking / project management.  When I worked at Touch Clarity (later swallowed by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Omniture<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was gobbled by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adobe<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) I was desperately looking for a product to help us:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Record defects<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Capture new feature requests<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Assign tasks to developers<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Estimate tasks<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Track progress - both at a project level and for individual developers<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Provide us with a lightweight process which was easy to follow<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Generate reports for management.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->From the demo I saw, FogBugz will do everything we wanted at that time.  We were using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bugzilla<!-- raw HTML omitted --> back then, and badly.  I'd also investigated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XPlanner<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VersionOne<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a bunch of other defect/project management tools, and not really seen anything that did what I wanted (certainly that was cheap enough).  But this was back in 2004/5, we were doing a half-hearted version of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->eXtreme Programming<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and we didn't have a lot of cash to burn.  It was hard then to find a lightweight, customisable, inexpensive tool.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The things I saw in FogBugz that I thought would be useful were:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice UI - usability of these things is so frequently under-valued.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really easy to track what's going on with a defect, to add and edit comments etc.  I actually liked that the edit feature still tracked versions of the comments, I can see how some organisations would need that audit trail.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evidence-based scheduling - I liked the way that it uses past information to have a good guess at how accurate an estimate will be, and therefore the soonest, likely and latest times a feature might be delivered by.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visibility over an individual developer's workload.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visibility over work at a project-level<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Loads of charts/reports to let you slice and dice the stuff you have in there.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dependency management<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neat integration to source control - yes, I know you can get this for loads of management tools now, it doesn't mean it's not useful. It seemed pretty slick here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seemed quick.  But then it could have been a locally-running instance with about 3 defects in it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The things I thought would not be so useful in a more Agile environment:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evidence-based scheduling<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visibility over an individual developer's workload.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lots of the ways the data can be sliced and diced<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dependency management<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, you like it and you don't like it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yeah yeah, I've gone all multiple-personality again.  The stuff I liked about the product would be dead useful for the types of projects that work that way - where you assign work to individual developers who estimate the work; where developers are assigned to specific projects; where stories / features might not be broken down into small, independent tasks.  These places might be running waterfall, or some agile-ish process, or no process at all.  A tool like this will give them much better visibility over what's going on, over which deadlines won't be met, over who's estimates are flaky and who's are generally reliable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However even before I joined <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ThoughtWorks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, before I joined <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LMAX<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I was sold on Agile as a more natural way to run development teams (this is despite having worked with Touch Clarity's sort-of-XP and A Very Large Media Organisation's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ScrumBut<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).  The problems that some of the features in FogBugz tries to address are similar to the problems that Agile (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->XP<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scrum<!-- raw HTML omitted -->/<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kanban<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or some hybrid of these) is also supposed to address.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evidence-based scheduling: I totally agree with getting statistical about this - teams and management should have a good idea how reliable estimates are.  But one of the ways to reduce the variation is to have the estimates done by the team.  At LMAX, we would have three developers estimate every story.  With any luck at least one of those would know enough about it to provide some solid technical guidance on what was involved, but if there wasn't someone in a group of three that had that knowledge, chances were pretty good the team generally were going to be pretty vague on it.  Granted, if you're using FogBugz you can enter the team estimate instead of just the individual who is going to implement it and then your evidence-based scheduling will be for team-estimates instead of personal ones.  This is totally fine, in fact it's a good thing - I just think we shouldn't use evidence-based scheduling to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the problem that estimates are just that - an estimate, a guess.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visibility over a developer's workload: If you're doing pair programming (XP), if the team takes ownership of the implementation of features / stories (Scrum), there's no need to look at how busy an individual developer is.  Yes, there are lots of organisations that do allocate work to individuals.  In many (most?) Agile-practicing teams, this will not be happening.  So really you only need visibility over a team or project level.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reporting: Ah, I love reporting.  I love data, statistics, pretty charts. Maybe I'm secretly a project manager.  But it's SO easy to get hung up on the stats, on one tiny measurement, rather than the bigger picture - are we getting closer to &ldquo;done&rdquo; or not?  I think you should be able to get at all that data, but not get carried away micro-optimising for metrics which may be hiding bigger problems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dependency management: another thing that is dead important in some types of teams or organisations.  But the last few Agile projects I've worked on have not tracked hard-link dependencies at all - each story should stand alone, should be estimated on the basis of just doing that piece of work.  Yes, this is idealistic, and even in the projects where we did not officially track dependencies, we'd have a good idea of a very general order things should be done in (or an idea of the order things could be done in to make life easier).  But these things can be fluid, if a specific feature needs to be done now, you shouldn't have to do every single story that might have a tiny piece of functionality this story is dependent on - just tackle this story and everything you need for it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All of those points could be blog posts in their own right, I know it's taken me years to get my head around the way I personally see Agile.  But you get the idea, or maybe you don't - that's fine, maybe you're in exactly the sort of place that could use FogBugz to improve your productivity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz vs Mingle<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I started at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ThoughtWorks<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last week, so I'd better mention that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ThoughtWorks Studios<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have a competitor product, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mingle<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I'm reasonably well-qualified to talk about it since I've been using it in anger for the last two years in a maturing agile environment, and I had my Mingle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->indoctrination<!-- raw HTML omitted --> induction last week.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, the main difference is the angle the two products are taking to approach the same problem: how do you provide a tool that<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->is easy and lightweight enough to use that people (particularly developers) will keep it up to date;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tracks just the right amount of data that people have visibility over the state of development (What are we doing?  Are we going to hit our deadlines? What are our blockers?)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, it seems FogBugz is coming from the traditional development model - it might not be anything as formal as waterfall, but it may not be based on short iterations and assumes individuals rather than teams are assigned work.  Mingle was developed for the Agile team, e.g. collective responsibility, pair programming, short iterations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mingle is highly configurable, and while FogBugz has a number of templates and custom work flows, Mr Spolsky specifically stated at the demo that these really shouldn't be used.  That they've worked hard to find a process that works, and we should all follow that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, Mingle embraces the differences between teams/processes and FogBugz specifically discourages it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I reckon these things are actually also the potential downfalls for both products too:  Mingle can be abused so badly that it adds no value; FogBugz could be so prescriptive it slows down productivity.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But it's horses for courses, every tool has its advantages and disadvantages.  Or should I be pushing Mingle at this point until I pass my probation??<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kiln, and an introduction to DVCS<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good Lord, I've written all that stuff and that's only from the short demo at the start of the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fortunately I have a lot less to say about the latter part.  It was an introduction to Distributed Version Control (DVCS), and it was pitched absolutely right for someone like me.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've never used a DVCS; most recently I've been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Subversion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I've also used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PVCS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ClearCase<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->VSS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and a bunch of others (in fact, I'm pretty sure I've had to learn a new source control system every time I've switched project or company!).  I've been introduced to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Git<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over a lunchtime, and I read Martin Fowler's blog post on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->version control tools<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  The intro provided by FogCreek was spot on for me.  It showed me:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The differences between a DVCS and something like Subversion (OK, specifically svn, which is fine for me);<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Advantages of using a distributed source control system;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some mindsets that you need to change when switching from svn to a DVCS like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mercurial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The FogCreek way of setting up the repositories.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last point was particularly useful in giving some real-life examples of how to use a DVCS and why.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then there was some stuff on why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kiln<!-- raw HTML omitted --> might give you more than just the freebie Mercurial install.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was more useful in a general fashion than the FogBugz section.  However, like the FogBugz talk, I got a good feel for the types of teams/companies Kiln might be good for, and why you might use it.  Personally it convinced me that using a DVCS in general is probably better than Subversion (insert usual disclaimer of different tools being appropriate for different situations).  It certainly encourages working practices that will lead to a) less accidental loss of code (after all, that's what source control is for) and b) if well organised, better separation of bugs / features / stories and better integration across versions and branches.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to know what I've been blathering on about in this section, check out Joel's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->excellent introduction to Mercurial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  OK, I admit it, I haven't read it all.  But it seems to cover everything that was covered in the conference session, with Joel's usual wit and appeal to the developer mindset.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Other News<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In terms of an education session, the &ldquo;World Tour&rdquo; was excellent - succinct, easy to digest, and (to my mind) aimed exactly at the audience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->However<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  I actually ended the (half) day being slightly disappointed, and not just because these tools don't seem to be ideal for the Agile team. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I didn't get enough of a chance to network.  Now, I'm happy to admit this is a problem I regularly have - because, like many developers, I find it difficult to talk to new people in a big room full of people I don't know.  However, given that this was a big room full of developers, I wish there had been more of an effort made to help us to mix and network. Before the talks we were on tables in another room having coffee etc, which I liked because it did lead to some conversation in small groups.  But I would have been nice if there had been a chance at the end of the talks to chat to people and dissect the session (if there actually was, it was so badly publicised I missed it).  I went with a stack of business cards and didn't give a single one out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The half day didn't seem like enough.  But this might be more a reflection of the above point since I got what I wanted from the talks, any more would have been too much info.  So maybe I just wanted more time with the attendees and with the FogCreek guys.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was shocked by how few women there were.  I'm no tech newbie, I've been to training sessions, conferences, user groups, seminars, and worked on site at a lot of different types of places.  I was very surprised to see that in a room of several hundred people I counted 5 women (myself included).  This seems low even for gathering of techies, it seems <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> low for a presentation on a piece of software that is effectively project management software.  I don't have the stats to hand, but in my personal experience any technical event with even a sniff of project management stuff is better represented across both genders.  I wouldn't normally comment on it because it's something I'm used to myself, but I've been asked a bunch of times in the last two weeks &ldquo;what do we need to do to encourage more participation by women?&quot;, and I have my eyes open for stuff which might help me answer that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Conclusion<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A generally good, well-run event, especially as it was free (if I recall correctly).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->FogBugz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kiln<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are excellent tools for a certain type of organisation / team, and I'm not talking about a small minority of teams here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you're Agile, these tools are probably not for you.  You can get them to work, and if you're &ldquo;kind of&rdquo; agile they're probably better than a lot of your options.  But true agile teams running an effective process might find themselves hindered more than helped.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm going to download and install a DVCS the very next time I have to write a line of code.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
