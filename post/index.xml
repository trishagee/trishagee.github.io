      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; is working together towards completing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt; on
lambdas and streams. As part of this, we&amp;rsquo;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
during the course so we can, as a group, ask  questions about the lectures, get help with the homework, and (if we&amp;rsquo;re
feeling very smart!) help people who may be struggling (or might not have watched the videos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night we had the first session which went really well. We had a small-ish group, about half of whom had
completed the homework and the quiz (for the first lesson) and half had not. We worked through the homework exercises
together, saw how there were multiple solutions for each problem, and explored how to balance conciseness with
longer, more descriptive code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;First offline session for lesson 1 of the lambdas and streams mooc &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/java8?src=hash&#34;&gt;#java8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/40gradosAlaSombra?src=hash&#34;&gt;#40gradosAlaSombra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/hJgPrLl3C5&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJgPrLl3C5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; SVQ JUG (@SVQJUG) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SVQJUG/status/623199430158778368&#34;&gt;July 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole people thought the videos for the course were very clear and well-explained, although we also went
through how to run the videos at 1.5 speed, as most people wanted to run through them faster! I thought the pace of the
videos was especially good for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t so comfortable with listening in English, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add
subtitles and speed it up if you feel comfortable with the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lesson covers lambdas, and their use in some of the new Java 8 methods (specifically on collections, but
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; streams).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas we discussed most, the ones that needed more clarity were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html&#34;&gt;Functional Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;:
what does &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-functional-1&#34;&gt;Single Abstract Method (SAM)&lt;/a&gt; really mean? Also, we
were interested in the &amp;ldquo;exception&amp;rdquo; of methods declared on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; as well as an interface (e.g. &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;), but we
came
to the conclusion that it was easier to simply think of looking for only one method without any form of
implementation at all - methods defined on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; must have an implementation, since &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is not an
abstract class or interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html&#34;&gt;Method References&lt;/a&gt;: we looked at
examples of the three types that aren&amp;rsquo;t constructor references, what they look like in lambda form and how they
differ. Method references are&amp;hellip; not difficult to understand, but do look a bit awkward in the code if you&amp;rsquo;re not
used to them, and can be confusing as all your types, parameters and return values disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel execution: The first lesson talks a lot about how lambdas are here to make parallelisation and
concurrency easier for developers, so obviously there was a question about how the code in the homework examples would
be executed in a multi-CPU environment. I assumed (although I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for clarification) that methods like
&lt;code&gt;removeIf&lt;/code&gt; are not parallelised, since in the case of Streams you have to explicitly state you want to go parallel.
We also talked a bit about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#parallel--&#34;&gt;parallel()&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#parallelStream--&#34;&gt;parallelStream()&lt;/a&gt;, even
though the lesson didn&amp;rsquo;t cover Streams at all. We wanted to understand a bit more about the pros and cons of going
parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great, collaborative session, with most people getting a chance to demonstrate their code (if they wanted
to!). And at the end we had solutions to the five exercise problems and had discussed all the areas people wanted
more clarity on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at QCon New York (probably my business conference this year!) I was
interviewed by Ralph Winzinger for InfoQ. It felt like a short interview at the time,
but we covered a lot of ground - Java 8, Java vs other JVM languages, the effectiveness
of the JCP, and the future of Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video and the transcript are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-java-eco-system&#34;&gt;available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Path To Evangelism</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/becoming_an_evangelist/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/becoming_an_evangelist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I get asked a lot about how I got into technical advocacy /
evangelism&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
so it seems like the most cost-effective way to answer this question is to
write a post about it. Warning: it&amp;rsquo;s a long one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me caveat this (I always have caveats, don&amp;rsquo;t I?) with, &amp;ldquo;this is
my personal experience&amp;rdquo;.  There may be other ways to get into this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any long-time readers of the blog (I love you guys!!) will
know that I started blogging before I did any of this
running-around-the-world-speaking-at-conferences lark.  I started blogging
for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even &amp;ldquo;back then&amp;rdquo; (probably around 2007), it was definitely an advantage to
have something external to the day job to differentiate you from other job
candidates.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable with open source, Stack Overflow
wasn&amp;rsquo;t invented yet (and even if it had been, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would have felt
knowledgeable enough to answer questions), and most of what I had learnt in
order to level-up my skills
was via blogs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/&#34;&gt;Rands in Repose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed writing. One of the (many) things I had wanted to be
&amp;ldquo;when I grew up&amp;rdquo; was a writer or a journalist. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take that path
because I thought if I did I would be Poor Forever.  However, if I started
practising my writing in a blog, I would learn to find my voice, and have
something to show book publishers if I ever did get around to writing a
book, like I had always wanted to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  you&amp;rsquo;ve ever started a blog, you know the problem is thinking of things to
write about. I generally documented things I&amp;rsquo;d had difficulty getting
working, because a) if I had trouble with the existing documentation, other
people would too and b) I have a memory like a goldfish, so it would be
useful for me if nothing else. But it took me years to really take the blog
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2008, I joined the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, largely
because I had returned to London from a year working in New York, and a) I needed a new job (during
the height of the crisis, when my recent experience was all financial
markets!) and b) although I had friends in London, I needed to rebuild my
social networks, and I was using meetup.com to do this. I tried lots of other
meetup groups, but like many geeks, I found it hard to connect to people
without the common ground of tech or code to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I ended up working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and
because we were always looking
for keen, bright developers, I started getting much more involved in the LJC
so that I could help us hire people I actually wanted to work with. During
this time, people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jr0cket&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;
and, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcrecworks&#34;&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt; were
encouraging me, consciously or not, to do a bit of technical presenting. I saw
a lot of different talks there, some from professional evangelists from
vendors, but many from &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; developers like me. It made me think that
a) I should do this (awesome for your profile/career etc) and b) I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I saw very few women presenting (I do remember an
awesome presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fabianenardon&#34;&gt;Fabiane&lt;/a&gt;) and
also very few women members. Many members
assumed I was a recruiter, even before I started trying to chat to people
to, well, recruit them for LMAX. In the first 2 minutes of meeting someone,
if they didn&amp;rsquo;t ask me directly if I was in recruitment or HR, I would always
make it clear that I was a Java developer. It was tedious but something I
just got used to. Interestingly, once it was clear I was a Java person,
people seemed to accept that and just treat me like any other techie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the reasons I decided to start doing presentations - I
could a) show my own technical credentials, so I would spend less time having
these tiresome conversations (which, by the way, seems to have worked) and
b) make it more normal to see women techies, hopefully minimising the number
times other women faced the same assumptions (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this worked or
not, as I only have my own experiences to look at).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these thoughts were only floating around my mind, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything.  During this time, while working at LMAX, it seemed like there were lots of
things I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; blog about, or talk about, but I never really got round to it.
Plus, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what I was allowed to talk about and what I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
talking about. So apparently during these two years I only wrote a total of 6
posts, and I never did a single presentation at the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I really wanted to do presenting and have time/inspiration for the
blog, so I chose to leave LMAX and join
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; - they were looking for
consultants and I knew this was a company that valued blogging and
presenting, and I&amp;rsquo;d had some exposure to their guys through the LJC and,
years before, I&amp;rsquo;d seen them speaking at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-london.html&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;,
which had actually been my initial inspiration for blogging.
I told LMAX that was why I was leaving, and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s 2011, and I&amp;rsquo;ve joined ThoughtWorks. I revived the blog while I was
unassigned to a project, I invested that time in porting the blog to a
more sensible platform, and trying to write a blog a day. Again, I picked
topics I could comfortably talk about - I spoke about my experiences as a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/my_experiences_with_android_development/&#34;&gt;beginner trying Android for the first
time&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes people will be arsey
with beginners, but in reality many real human beings can&amp;rsquo;t tell you you&amp;rsquo;re
wrong when you&amp;rsquo;re just talking about your own experiences), and despite my
original intent to blog with zero gender identity (I was genuinely afraid
that if I wrote about tech subjects and I was wrong, or very junior, I would
give women programmers a bad name) I decided to blog about &amp;ldquo;the women in
technology subject&amp;rdquo;. Again, here I went for my personal opinion/experiences,
for which only mean people can criticise you (mean people are easier to
ignore than correct people :) )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also fortunate enough to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;
in person while he was over
in London. We were talking over drinks (this is London, after all) about the
women in technology thing (ThoughtWorks are really big on this subject, and
determined to do something positive in this area), and I was complaining about
the lack of women at a particular conference. He asked me if I had submitted
a talk for the conference.  Me?? Of course not! I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for that! I&amp;rsquo;ve
got nothing to talk about. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been given permission to do this, or
guidance on how to do it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even presented at the user group yet. But
it did make me think - I said I wanted to present, so what was stopping me?
Did I need someone to guide me through it, to assign it to me as a task? It
was going to be up to me to make this happen. And if Martin Fowler, who
had just met me 5 minutes beforehand, thinks I&amp;rsquo;m ready to do this, then who&amp;rsquo;s
to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m not? What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course life then got in the way - I was assigned to a couple of projects,
so the blogging stopped. I was interested in attending or
speaking at conferences, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to have anything ThoughtWorksy to
talk about for quite a while. And now, because I was commuting to my assigned
project, I had very little time even for the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, LMAX called
to let me know that the talk they&amp;rsquo;d done at QCon San Francisco,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Do 100K TPS at Less than 1ms Latency&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had been
enormously popular, and they were open sourcing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to do
some evangelism around this - did I want to come back and help a) do
evangelism and b) co-ordinate the company&amp;rsquo;s evangelism?  Yes, yes I did. So,
after just 3 months, I quit TW and went back to LMAX&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at LMAX, I started to take evangelism more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to blog every week - I set aside Sundays for blogging (at the time
I was, fortunately for my particular choices, single and not overburdened
with a social life outside of the LJC). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to sit all alone in my
tiny flat, so I&amp;rsquo;d go to the pub with my shiny new Macbook Air, bought
specially for blogging (thanks ThoughtWorks, you spoiled me - I needed a mac
after I&amp;rsquo;d invested 3 months getting to grips with the one you gave me) and
write &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always amazing, but I&amp;rsquo;d do something. During the
week, when ideas came to me, I&amp;rsquo;d make a note of the title in the blogging
tool so that when Sunday came I&amp;rsquo;d pick one and go with it.  Early on it was
fairly easy - we&amp;rsquo;d released a white paper on the Disruptor, but I found it
hard to understand what it really meant, so I spent Sundays writing shorter
articles breaking down how it worked and how to use it. I needed a LOT of
help from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.real-logic.co.uk/about.html&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mikeb2701&#34;&gt;Mike
Barker&lt;/a&gt; to understand it, but they were patient
with me (plus I think they were happy that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; was writing this and it
didn&amp;rsquo;t
have to be them). They took the heavier, more complicated subjects and I
pitched my stuff at developers like myself. When I ran out of Disruptor
stuff, I moved on to the topics I had in the backlog - I generally had more
ideas for blogs than time to blog, so I ended up with quite a long list to
pick from. The key is to make a note of it at the time you think of it, and
not try and think of a topic when you sit down with time to blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I coordinated our events and publicised them on the new LMAX blog I&amp;rsquo;d created.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davefarley77&#34;&gt;Dave Farley&lt;/a&gt; was often presenting on
something Continuous Delivery related since
&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1NyUQ53&#34;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; had been released, and Martin was talking
about hardcore concurrency stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike and I got even more involved in the LJC, not just to recruit people.  We
got involved in the JCP and OpenJDK - since LMAX was doing cutting edge
technology stuff with Java, we wanted to see where the language was going
and influence it too if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martijn must&amp;rsquo;ve got fed up my lack of drive in the presenting area, as he
pretty much forced me to do my first presentation.  In a
nice way! But he told me I was ready, he checked my content before I did it,
and I did a short talk on the JCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, my plan was to spend this first year of presenting doing short
talks at the JUG, maybe work my way up to a longer talk by the end of the year, or maybe
the following year, then the year after that to submit to conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, with amazing mentors like mine, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Martin Thompson was
due to
give a talk at JavaOne at the end of that year (still 2011), and I was lucky
enough to get a ticket at the last minute (we won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.net/dukeschoice/2011&#34;&gt;Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award
for Innovative Programming Framework&lt;/a&gt;,
and LMAX was awesome enough to let me have the ticket to the
conference to receive the award, since the evangelism efforts and blogging
had had a direct influence on us winning this award). Martin
asked if I wanted to co-present with him. Of course this was terrifying! I
hadn&amp;rsquo;t even done a full length talk at the LJC, I had barely even been to a
conference, let alone presented at the largest Java conference In The World!
So I said yes. These opportunities do not come up every week. It&amp;rsquo;s a talk
Martin had given various times before, he would be there to pick up the slack
if I freaked out, and I knew this material, I&amp;rsquo;d been blogging about it and
answering questions for the last 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really was as terrifying as I thought.  But.  It went well. I answered
difficult questions. We got great feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011_roundup/&#34;&gt;JavaOne 2011&lt;/a&gt;
was an important milestone in my evangelism career.  Not only
did I get to put this presentation on my CV, I got to meet a lot of people in
this network: Martin introduced me to a lot of high performance specialists;
Martijn and Ben introduced me to people involved in the JCP, to other Java
User Group leaders, and we somehow got in to the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly party -
I finally got to meet a book publisher and get one step closer to my dream
of writing a book. I also met the ladies behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt;,
and they introduced me to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Stephan007&#34;&gt;Stephan&lt;/a&gt; who runs Devoxx. This turned out
to be an important step in turning an idea I had for a panel into a Devoxx
reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is October.  By the end of the year I had also presented at &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/&#34;&gt;JAX London
with Mike&lt;/a&gt;, and at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/why_we_shouldnt_target_women/&#34;&gt;Devoxx Belgium on a panel&lt;/a&gt;,
largely thanks to the contacts I
had made and the prestige of having a JavaOne talk under my belt.  So I went
from basically zero at the start of that year (my blog had been dormant for
years and I had no experience presenting) to having a blog with thousands of
hits a month and being an &amp;ldquo;international conference speaker&amp;rdquo;. In many ways I
got lucky, because the Disruptor was a really interesting, technical topic
that is in an area developers feel they should understand (high performance).
But I believe it was more a) determination to make this work, even if it
meant using my own time to write blogs and prepare presentations and b)
fantastic mentors who pushed me to do it and opened up their networks to me,
that facilitated this rapid rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, after that things were a lot easier - I had the experience
presenting at conferences, I had Martin and Martijn suggesting conferences to
me (and introducing me to the right people where appropriate), which got me
into the QCon/GOTO loop and into OSCON. With videos of my presentations
availble, combined with the reach of my blog, I also had people approaching
me to do other events, like user groups in the cities I was visiting, and
conferences I had never heard of.  I think it helped that I&amp;rsquo;m a woman,
because conferences are always actively looking to increase their diversity
(whatever it might seem like at times!), but I think that anyone could follow
these sorts of steps with a similar outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk much about my career after that, because really that&amp;rsquo;s
the tipping point - after that it was more of the same, really. I will say
that I left LMAX because the pressure to be a full time developer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; do
advocacy is hard, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re no longer single and you don&amp;rsquo;t have
the spare time you used to have. I joined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; because they were well known for
understanding the technical community, and because they were looking for an
evangelist who would continue to be an engineer (although not for 40 hours a
week every week). I think they might have hired me without the previous
experience, but the blogging and presenting experience was a big selling
point for the guy who became my boss.  I eventually left
them for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; because you learn, over
time, what your sweet spots are as an advocate/educator, and what your
interests are. After two years of MongoDB, I knew I really wanted to focus
on Java and the JVM, and JetBrains is a much better fit for that. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty
certain I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have got this job without a) having the
conference-presenting experience and therefore b) being known to the team
already through the conference circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. That was a massive post. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off
writing this for ages. That&amp;rsquo;s just my own story, I have another post in my
head about the challenges that face you on trying to sell the value of
evangelism/advocacy to your organisation (and maybe some suggestions). But
that&amp;rsquo;s for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I shall try to leave you with take-away points that I hope will
be helpful if you either want to become a technical advocate, or are interested
in just some aspects, like writing or presenting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a user group.  I cannot, &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; stress how important the LJC was to
my career. If you do nothing else, this is the one thing that can help you.
You will meet people who will inspire you or give you the kick up the
backside you need. Try to remember that many of these people, like me, were
developers like you before they became bloggers/authors/speakers. If they
can, you can. These people also have networks, and whether you like it or
not, it really is not what you know but who you know (but don&amp;rsquo;t let that put
you off - meeting the right people can be easier than becoming some sort of
super-expert!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present at the user group. Preferably get them to video it - you can use
this in submissions to conferences, if it&amp;rsquo;s not a blind CFP they will like to
see examples of your style. Having an example, even one that you think isn&amp;rsquo;t
awesome, is much, much better than having nothing at all. (Also, and this is
not a blog post about becoming a better speaker, but do watch your own
videos - it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; painful the first few times, but it gets easier and
will help you to improve).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to commit your own time to this. I blogged and prepared talks
at weekends, even for companies that valued evangelism. I gave up evenings
to attend the user group.  This will be
especially important in the early days when you probably have a day job too.
This investment should pay off, either your company will learn to see the
value of it and give you more time (having developers attend and speak at the
LJC was enormously successful for recruitment for LMAX), or you will get a
job better suited to what you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have something awesome to talk about. I got lucky with
the Disruptor, true. But our most in-demand topics at the Sevilla Java User
Group are &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; topics, especially for things that are
no-longer cutting edge - not all developers were early adopters, and now they
need an overview of &amp;ldquo;why NoSQL&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s Docker&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be awesome. Your blog doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect English
(especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not a native). It just needs to clearly describe the
thing you&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain. You don&amp;rsquo;t
have to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/author/Damian-Conway&#34;&gt;Damian Conway&lt;/a&gt;(one of
my favourite presenters) when you speak - in my experience, a presenter
can get away with either &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great content or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great delivery, you
actually don&amp;rsquo;t need both. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to conferences where presenters haven&amp;rsquo;t
really had either - you have to start somewhere, and audiences are
surprisingly forgiving (especially at user groups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find mentors. Listen to them. You might not even meet them, you can watch
what they do. But I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to find real human beings who are a step
or two closer to where you want to be. Talk to them, let them know what you
want. And let them bully you into doing scary things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be yourself. Figure out your strengths and interests, and play to them. I
was scared of being a woman developer on show, via the blog or via
conferences, but it turns out to be an advantage. I was afraid that because
I&amp;rsquo;m not Martin Thompson I can&amp;rsquo;t possibly talk about difficult technical
subjects. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be him, I can be me - I can explain things to
the level that I need to understand them, so other developers like me can
catch up with me. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to all be genius-level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do things that scare you. The terrifying things are the things that got me
the furthest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Evangelism / Technical Advocacy - I use these terms fairly
interchangeably. Evangelism was the common name some years back, but many
are uncomfortable with the religious overtones, so instead prefer Advocacy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This is why I often talk about being at ThoughtWorks for a
minute and a half - I really loved a lot of things about the company, but what
I really wanted to do was offered to me in a company I already knew, where I
could get going straight away without any ramp up&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Android Xtended</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/android_xtended/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/android_xtended/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6771.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
calm before the storm&#34; title=&#34;The calm before the storm&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them.  I could claim lack of time, but
the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me
think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading
that, but I get bored of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6803.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34; title=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m bored of conferences. On the contrary - since I work from home, travelling to new places and
meeting Real Human Beings keeps me sane. Plus conferences are fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6753.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
setup&#34; title=&#34;The setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I went to a conference on Saturday that makes me feel compelled to write something, and not just because it was
organised by my two fellow &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla JUG&lt;/a&gt; organisers.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt; are both doing more Android day-to-day than
server-side Java, so this is an area they&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about. Not content with organising
Android events every other month, they decided they had so many interesting speakers they wanted to have speaking here
in Sevilla that they wanted to run a whole day, single track conference, on behalf of &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/communities/114997118727600981533&#34;&gt;GDG Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidxtended.com/&#34;&gt;Android Xtended&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6848.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Android Xtended&#34; title=&#34;Android Xtended&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;As a Java &amp;ldquo;Technical Advocate&amp;rdquo;, I suppose I should keep an eye on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the Android space, it&amp;rsquo;s quite a
huge part of the ecosystem&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go in any sort
of official capacity (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t speaking, manning a booth, organising or sponsoring), so I could just enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/registration.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hola...&#34; title=&#34;Hola...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they roped me into doing registrations. Me! I was concerned my Spanish wasn&amp;rsquo;t up for it, but apparently I only
needed two words: &amp;ldquo;nombre&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;talla&amp;rdquo; (for the t-shirt). Oh, and &amp;ldquo;treinta y uno b&amp;rdquo; - there was such demand for the
conference the initial venue wasn&amp;rsquo;t big enough, so it was being hosted at two sites on the same road. Not
surprisingly, some turned up to the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6813.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34; title=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a large number of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; events, all the talks were in Spanish. So feel
free to ignore my analysis if you like - my Spanish comprehension is pretty good, but sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t realise when
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand something and just make up my own story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float:left; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6794.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;@flipper83&#34; title=&#34;@flipper83&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in the Android space is Getting Started type material - a lot of tutorials and
examples that show you how to achieve a particular goal. There seems to be less of an emphasis on areas that
interest me as an experienced Java person - easy automation of testing, good design practices, craftsmanship etc. Now,
 it may be that because those areas (apart from testing) apply to both back-end Java and Android, there&amp;rsquo;s less of a
 need to re-iterate it in the Android space. Or it may be that I don&amp;rsquo;t see the entry-level Java stuff any more,
 because I don&amp;rsquo;t need it, and I seek out the topics that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6892.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
 alt=&#34;@JMPergar&#34; title=&#34;@JMPergar&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or it may be that as Android is one of those
 platforms that&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start as a fairly novice developer (because you can write self-contained code with
 a visible UI and get results fairly easily), lots of the focus is on the needs of new developers.  Whatever the
 reason, I had been starting to feel like the Android ecosystem was missing people taking developers beyond that
 initial step of getting something to work and up to the level of creating maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6880.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34; title=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended put my mind at rest. Here was a range of talks that led attendees through the things that will make
them more effective developers - tools and libraries to use; testing approaches; integration with persistence; clean
(code) design for the UI; design patterns and domain driven design to simplify your code, and so on. As an employee
of JetBrains, I was obviously very happy to see both
&lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html&#34;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; mentioned and used throughout as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6863.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@davilagrau&#34; title=&#34;@davilagrau&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as fantastic speakers (they knew their stuff, were clearly practitioners, and all had great individual
presentation styles), there were three mob-programming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6853.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mob Programming&#34; title=&#34;Mob Programming&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an ambitious attempt to not just preach to
a passive audience, but to involve them in creating real, working code to teach fundamental practices - dependency
injection, testing and Gradle.  An hour is barely enough time to give a practiced demo of real code, to create
something collaboratively with an audience of 30 people was a challenge. But I thought it did give people a flavour
of not just how to use the technologies, but what they were for. I also saw a lot of the audience starting to
realise the power of refactoring using an IDE - I firmly believe the best way to teach the power of a tool is by
pair programming or, at least, using the tool in real use cases in front of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6921.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;More collaboration&#34; title=&#34;More collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mob programming was kinda
like a half day tutorial squished into an hour. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear how the attendees found it. For me, since
this was a full day conference that cost €10, I thought getting three short tutorials as well as five excellent
talks was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6896.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy developers&#34; title=&#34;Happy developers&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6883.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;Interesting...&#34; title=&#34;Interesting...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss in talking about the conference if I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the venue.  We were at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt;, which was pretty easy to get to, and a really nice, airy, comfortable
space&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
And they let us rearrange their whole place just for us. The only downside is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold more people, which
is a shame, and the reason we had to host on two sites (I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on the other site as I stayed
at RES the whole day, but we&amp;rsquo;re very grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitnami.com/&#34;&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; for lending us their offices as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6831.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Collaboration&#34; title=&#34;Collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what did I learn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt; is a really nice space that hopefully we can use more regularly for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to use Good Practices to write Android code, and Real Developers are doing so for Real Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are very talented and expert technical speakers in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to two conferences in Spain in
the last month, but as they were all in English I think it puts some people off presenting. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see Spanish
talent being showcased, it gives developers here good role models and shows that experts aren&amp;rsquo;t just from outside
Spain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevilla has a very healthy tech scene with people more than happy to give up a Saturday to learn new things. In
fact, for some set of people, they prefer Saturdays to weekday
evenings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m about to lose more weekends in the
future&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6872.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;People like Saturdays?&#34; title=&#34;People like 
 Saturdays?&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended was a fantastic event, with great speakers and engaged attendees.  I loved how social
 everyone was during the breaks, how people were happy to chat and share stories, even though most of the attendees
 didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other beforehand. It was brilliantly organised, and although I did see how much work went into
 arranging it, you would never believe from how smoothly it went that this two-venue event was organised by just two
 guys. Well done &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6927.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Drinks&#34; title=&#34;Drinks&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Although in my experience Android and &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; Java user groups and events tend not to
 overlap much - not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a function of the relationship between Google and Oracle or just because large cities like
 London tend to split groups along technology lines to keep group and event sizes manageable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The downside was there are not a lot of places nearby open for coffee at 8am!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This is completely alien to me as someone who built her career largely in London - you
 do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; host events on a Saturday, except for maybe the annual LJC Open Conference, because many people have a
 long commute into the city. Doing that 5 days a week is plenty, most people don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it on a Saturday as
 well. But they will give up a couple of hours in the evening, as it costs far less in time overall.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blind CFPs - a Postscript</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since publishing &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great comments, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write yet
another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me state that I don&amp;rsquo;t think blind CFPs are a complete waste of time - for example, I know that there are
circles in which speakers will refuse to submit if the selection process isn&amp;rsquo;t blind. But what blind CFPs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;,
is an answer to &amp;ldquo;How do I get more women speakers at my conference?&amp;rdquo;, especially if the problem is not that the
women are being rejected, but that they simply aren&amp;rsquo;t submitting talks - this is the situation I see most frequently
in the conferences I speak at/help organise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;you-re-missing-the-point-of-blind-cfps:43f099050d27fb0647d57b33c7259595&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of blind CFPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to address the point &amp;ldquo;Blind CFPs are to protect the organisers, not simply to improve diversity&amp;rdquo;. OK, great. So
in the case of the conferences that had only two women out of 200 submissions: if you make that process blind, whether you
select both women or not, when there are nasty comments about your lack of women speakers, you&amp;rsquo;re protected - you did
the right things, you had a blind CFP, and just not many women made it through that process. Women simply aren&amp;rsquo;t
writing compelling abstracts and/or aren&amp;rsquo;t picking interesting subjects and/or clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in
presenting at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAAARRRGGHHHHHH!!!! Anger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protect your arse if you like, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I see the attacks against organisers and I understand the need to be able to
say you did the right thing. But notice that once you&amp;rsquo;ve protected yourselves, the blame is back on the
minorities for not meeting your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a blind CFP is to protect the selectors, then let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend it&amp;rsquo;s an answer to increasing diversity
of speakers, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-abstract-is-not-a-representation-of-your-talk:43f099050d27fb0647d57b33c7259595&#34;&gt;An abstract is not a representation of your talk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can emphasise this enough: blind CFPs have a very big weakness - there is no direct correlation between
a good abstract and a good talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a bunch of talks online lately, and I watched one with an abstract
that absolutely called to me - here was the missing piece for a technology that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around. I
gave an hour of my life to that talk, each minute I was wondering when this person would get to the bits mentioned
in the abstract, so I watched it all the way to the end. They never delivered what the abstract promised, and their
meandering style meant I learnt almost nothing from the talk. That&amp;rsquo;s an hour of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back. Good
thing I was playing computer games as well at the time, if I&amp;rsquo;d paid money for that I would have been very peeved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another weakness in this process - if you go to a number of conferences (like I do) you kinda learn which
speakers are doing
which talks.  If I submit my &amp;ldquo;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong??&amp;rdquo;
talk to a blind process, if there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on the selection committee who&amp;rsquo;s even vaguely involved in the Java or MongoDB
spaces, they&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s me. And they can Google the talk and decide whether they like it (or with any luck, the
buzz-word crammed title will do the job and they&amp;rsquo;ll say yes, although probably AngularJS is so 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abstract is like your presentation in the same way that your CV is like your ability to do your job - there&amp;rsquo;s a skill
to writing good abstracts (or CVs), but mastery of that skill does not necessarily mean mastery of the thing it
represents - the ability to present or the ability to do the job.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be sold on a blind process
being a good way to build &amp;ldquo;the best content available for the conference&amp;rdquo; until this disconnect is somehow solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;for-goodness-sake-trisha-the-postscript-is-nearly-longer-than-the-original-post:43f099050d27fb0647d57b33c7259595&#34;&gt;For goodness sake Trisha, the postscript is nearly longer than the original post&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to feedback from a bunch of people, and I have learnt more things (thanks everyone!). I am more sold on
a blind CFP being maybe part of a bigger process. But I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe it fixes the &amp;ldquo;we need more women speakers&amp;rdquo;
problem, which was the original claim that I wanted to dispute. Conferences have to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more active to address
this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am not sold on an abstract being a fair representation of the quality of a talk. Maybe a more realistic &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo;
audition would be to give the talk to an audience, like a user group, who rated the talk:
the organisers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t watch the talk, but they could use the ratings to decide. Yes, the user group could also
have biases that affect their rating, but when the speaker gives the talk at the conference, those attendees will also
have their biases too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blindness is not a realistic option, we just have to keep putting women (and other non-white-straight-men) in front of
audiences until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Blind CFPs Really The Answer?</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Off the back of &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I received a number of comments and questions
around blind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/&#34;&gt;CFPs&lt;/a&gt; (Call For Papers - usually to get into a conference you submit to a CFP) for
conferences. I often hear it said that a blind CFP will fix, or at least improve, the diversity imbalance at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I should caveat this with: this is going to be a blog post based on my experiences and chats with people, and I
have zero science to back this up. Sorry. But I do have some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of London conferences that I won&amp;rsquo;t name (because I haven&amp;rsquo;t asked their permission not because they&amp;rsquo;ve
done anything wrong) that in some years have received only 2 from around 200 (or more) submissions from women. These
conferences have accepted 100% of the submissions from women, and then been open to criticism for not having enough women
speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blind CFP to remove unconscious bias from the selection committee might have resulted in zero women speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know the next argument is that advertising a blind CFP might encourage a wider diversity of speakers to apply. This
does seem to work in some parts of the industry (I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to women from tech scenes that don&amp;rsquo;t intersect with mine
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see that we have different problems in different segments of the wider development world). But for my
world, which is largely Java, with some forays into Agile, NoSQL, Open Source, and Enterprise, the women I speak to
aren&amp;rsquo;t scared they&amp;rsquo;ll be discriminated against if they put their name on a CFP. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to
lose by submitting and being rejected. They&amp;rsquo;re more afraid they&amp;rsquo;ll be accepted, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll have to give a
presentation! No, the women I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to in my world don&amp;rsquo;t submit because they don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready, they don&amp;rsquo;t think they
have anything to talk about, and they&amp;rsquo;re worried about the sorts of questions they&amp;rsquo;ll get asked when they&amp;rsquo;re standing up
there. Those fears aren&amp;rsquo;t allayed by having a blind CFP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any fears of being judged as a woman, it&amp;rsquo;s when we&amp;rsquo;re standing up in front of people at the conference, and
no amount of blindness during the CFP process is going to make us feel better about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, I find the idea of a blind CFP terrifying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if you have such a problem with judging people based on race or gender that you have to anonymise the
selection process, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to speak at your conference where my gender will be blatantly on show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, when I was starting out as a speaker, I was new to writing titles and abstracts and expected that they would
not be good enough to get in. With a blind CFP I would never find out why as I could never ask for feedback on my
anonymous abstract. As a novice speaker, I expected my gender would help me be selected, not hinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, as an experienced speaker I know my abstract-writing has not really improved, but I know my presenting has,
and I know there are videos of me out there doing a good job as a presenter, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is my audition tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was starting out as a speaker, I knew there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough women presenters around. And although I hate the idea
of positive discrimination and hate the idea that men might think I got into my position merely because I&amp;rsquo;m female, I knew
that being a woman made me stand out in all those submissions. And I knew that enough conferences would take a chance on
me, if only to improve their diversity, and that&amp;rsquo;s all I needed to bootstrap my speaking career - once I had spoken at
enough conferences, once I had videos of me doing that, I would find it much easier to get into the next conferences.
And that&amp;rsquo;s worked. And now, as an experienced (female) speaker, I fear blind CFPs as they won&amp;rsquo;t know who I am or what I&amp;rsquo;m
capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion as a female speaker. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to be on the programme committee for a couple
of conferences, and after three years or so of speaking at conferences I know a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of conference organisers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s
assume you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;merely&amp;rdquo; trying to build the best conference you can around your subject whilst not discriminating against
anyone (i.e. let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re not going out of your way to actively promote diversity). How can you do this when you only
have abstracts and titles to go on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903&#34;&gt;studies around blind auditions for orchestras&lt;/a&gt;. And I understand
how tempting it is to try to apply that to our world, since it has had an effect on the number of women in orchestras
(but let&amp;rsquo;s not get too excited here, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about an increase from 5% to 25% over thirty years&amp;hellip;). I think
blind auditions would work really well for coding - we can look at just the code, without knowing anything about the
physical body behind the code, and figure out if that person is good enough for us. We could even do blind pair
programming, using screen sharing and chat (actually that&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll patent that!). Because
the thing you&amp;rsquo;ve anonymised (the code) is the output you really care about in a programming job. If you communicate via
chat you can even measure someone&amp;rsquo;s communication skills without judging them physically, another vital skill for
being part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a talk abstract is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the output we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Sure, a good title and abstract will attract attendees to the
conference and bums on seats in the actual talk. But the output you&amp;rsquo;re looking for is the presenter - their style, their
approach to the topic, their ability to hold attention, their ability to impart information. We&amp;rsquo;re not always looking
for the same things either, an interesting topic presented nervously but logically is fine, as is an entertaining
presenter reminding us of fundamentals we already know (and any other combination of strengths and weaknesses). An abstract
can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good the presentation is going to be. Evaluating a presentation on a blind abstract would be like
evaluating those musicians on a couple of paragraphs explaining what they&amp;rsquo;re going to play and how they&amp;rsquo;re going to
try to make you feel when they play it - the words could sound great, but the musician might not even be able to play
the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best audition you can have as a presenter is to, well, present. Videos, audio clips, even screencasts. But the
problem with presenting is that it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking obvious that you&amp;rsquo;re a woman (or other variation on
non-white-straight-male).  If you can&amp;rsquo;t objectively evaluate a presentation without taking away the presenter&amp;rsquo;s
physical body (for colour
or gender or whatever), then you&amp;rsquo;ve got real problems. Your audience is going to be faced with that physical body for an
hour of their life, and you can bet they&amp;rsquo;ll be judging them too.  You want to be damned sure that you&amp;rsquo;ve selected a
competent presenter, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stand by that choice. Saying &amp;ldquo;oh, well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem boring in their
abstract&amp;rdquo; is not going to make the audience feel like you did a good job of the selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another point about non-blind selection processes, other than the process allowing you to select on presentation
ability rather than abstract-writing ability: you can be more active in promoting diversity. I am against &amp;ldquo;affirmative
action&amp;rdquo;, but if the proportion of women submitting presentations is lower than the proportion of women in the field, there&amp;rsquo;s
something missing.  Here are some of the things you can do if you identify a lack of a certain demographic - as usual,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;, but you could equally argue this for any demographic, even not-enough-C#-developers or
too-many-startups-not-enough-enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to relevant user groups and communities asking them to submit.  In London for example, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/&#34;&gt;Ladies Who Code&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-london/&#34;&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://london.girlgeekdinners.com/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/&#34;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-London/&#34;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/&#34;&gt;Women in Data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekgirlmeetup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/WIGJMeetup/&#34;&gt;Women in Games Jobs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://girlsintechuk.com/community/&#34;&gt;Girls in Tech&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Geek-Girls-Unite-London/&#34;&gt;Girl Geeks Unite&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://witi.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/&#34;&gt;whole host of women techies meetups&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t think I psychically
know about all those
because I have two X chromosomes, I found half of those just now, in less than two minutes, by Googling
&amp;ldquo;Girl Geeks London&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women Tech London&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the faces of the women you do want to have speak (or the women on your programme committee, or both) on your
website - showing these women sends the message that this conference is for women. It should also impact the diversity
of your attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to specific women speakers and ask them to present. &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;,
women speakers are few and far between, and a) they get
booked in advance and b) are busy enough not to have to (or want to) submit via a CFP process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;more ideas here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more - you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to drain the pool dry of known competent speakers-who-tick-some-diversity-box. With
a non-blind process you can actively improve the submissions you do have, assuming you&amp;rsquo;re not one of the conferences
suffering from a complete lack of submissions from those people. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to increase the number of women
presenting at your conference, if you have women submitting but they don&amp;rsquo;t quite meet your criteria (maybe the abstract
is weak, the title isn&amp;rsquo;t catchy, or maybe the presenter simply isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet) you, as the conference organiser, are
in the perfect position to mentor these people: you can help them re-write their abstracts; you can offer them mentoring
and training for presenting. If there&amp;rsquo;s no record of them presenting but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in evaluating their ability,
you can set them up with a user group to present at - as a conference organiser, you have the network contacts that
new speakers might not. You can run sessions aimed at people who have never done public speaking (I&amp;rsquo;ve run a session
like this four times now, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and at Ladies Who Code -
I had &lt;em&gt;over 70&lt;/em&gt; RSVPs for the last London Ladies Who Code session, twice the number of the last LJC session,
so there are plenty of women interested in breaking into this field, who are looking for training, who don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready
to present yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what are my points?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process of selection can be applied to something where the output you&amp;rsquo;re selecting for can be effectively
anonymised: music auditions, code, technical writing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A blind process where you select based on criteria that are not the end result will only be effective
if it&amp;rsquo;s the selection process is biased, or if submissions to the selection process are lower
from discriminated-against-groups because they fear a biased selection process.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those conferences that are getting very tiny numbers of submissions from women (I&amp;rsquo;m picking women as the example
but you can pick any group you want), a blind process could lead to even fewer selected women speakers. Instead of
switching to a blind process, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to want to check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the messaging around your conference (remember masculine words like rock star, ninja, competitive, hardcore,
challenging etc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/31438/&#34;&gt;put women off applying to jobs&lt;/a&gt;, the same probably applies to technical conferences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subliminal messages on your website/info (one of the conferences I mentioned, for example, sent out a couple of emails
containing photos of previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences which happened to only show men - this was not even representative of
the conference, but it can have an unexpectedly big effect on the subconscious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have you showcased the diversity of the conference, or previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences, with photos, interviews, testamonials?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A non-blind submission process allows you to be more active in promoting diversity - instead of hoping that the
submissions are representative of the diversity in your community, and that selecting the most interesting talks
will naturally lead to improved diversity, with a non-blind process you can track exactly how many women are submitting,
address problems in this area early and offer mentoring to those who aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet. Remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/0-qualified/&#34;&gt;women
only apply for jobs they feel 100% qualified for&lt;/a&gt;
and take fewer chances, they might need that extra push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, no. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that implementing a blind CFP will address the lack of diversity in conference speakers. I
know it helps in some circles, but I personally think that conference selection committees should a) be much better at
identifying their own biases and actively attempting to overcome them b) be active in improving the diversity of
their conference, and c) be offering feedback and mentoring to those who are not quite ready yet in order to improve
the overall ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity isn&amp;rsquo;t going to accidentally happen when we stop looking at gender and race and other visible you-don&amp;rsquo;t-belong-here
cues.  Diversity is only going to happen if people fight for it, and if we actively train, mentor, and support those
trying to break through the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m so tired of it all</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We work so hard to promote equality, to fight for the rights of people who are not middle-class
white men, and time and again it just feels like we&amp;rsquo;re not getting anywhere.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internationalwomensday.com/&#34;&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s
Day&lt;/a&gt; highlights the issues that face women all around the world, and make our
women-in-tech problem
look like a genuine &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems&#34;&gt;First World Problem&lt;/a&gt;, and yet we can&amp;rsquo;t even get that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave up. This weekend I thought, fuck it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my bit. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the phase in my
career where being a woman was a disadvantage and somehow arrived out the other side - in my position, in my job, it&amp;rsquo;s
an advantage, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to change anything to improve things for my career. I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry on doing my job to the best
of my ability, but I&amp;rsquo;m no longer going to let this diversity thing drain my energy - nothing ever seems to make a difference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, four (white, middle-class, English-speaking) men who I know well, who
I have seen by their actions are champions of women in technology, who have personally mentored
me in some way or another, have been accused of not thinking about women techies, not encouraging them - have
been accused of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This third year of being on the programme committee for QCon, I could see we had achieved far more to promote diversity
than ever before, but it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much work to get that far, and there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another conference I have great affection for which has never previously suffered badly from a lack of women speakers
received practically
zero submissions for full conference talks from women this year. The submissions that did come in were from the usual
suspects, the speakers who one calls upon when desperately trying to shore up the gender diversity of your speaker line-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sevilla Java User Group, which I started, with my money, which I present at regularly, has had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; female
developers attend who were not previously friends. Apparently the impact of visible female role models is far smaller than
I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so much work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s thankless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the men who support the women, they get attacked by both sides - by women, for not
doing enough, or sometimes for simply being privileged white men, by men and women for fighting for something that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact them, and by men for betraying their gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the women, it&amp;rsquo;s the same but more so: some women accuse us of not doing enough, some women sneer at what we&amp;rsquo;re doing,
telling us we already have equality, men and women think you&amp;rsquo;re in it just to improve your own life, and the men, well,
many men genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t understand the problems (and it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting to explain), and some are outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to find men allies.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but at this stage in my career I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by men
who are all allies. And I can honestly say that any professional struggles I&amp;rsquo;ve had in recent years I can see are suffered
by my colleagues of the opposite sex, so I know they&amp;rsquo;re not because of my gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that our male allies suffer the same way we do, even though they get even less out of fighting our battles
than we do. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s fair that they are attacked by both genders, and have to put up with unfair, unjust
criticism and accusations. After all, look at some of the vile, hate-filled messages thrown at women leading the charge -
that&amp;rsquo;s abuse. Some of these women fear for their lives.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live that life, and I despair that we live in a
society that can&amp;rsquo;t seem to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m a bit burnt out. So my friends are finding it tough. But this is a marathon, not a sprint.  And I never did this
for me anyway. I care about diversity because it matters. I try to change the gender balance specifically, because that&amp;rsquo;s an area I
might be able to impact, one I have a chance of understanding. I care about equality, about justice, because
it matters. And I do my tiny part to try and drown out the hate, the anger, the &amp;ldquo;get back into the kitchen, woman&amp;rdquo;
because those things make me feel sick, because &amp;ldquo;you can be whoever you want to be&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a lie, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come
with caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or energy for large-scale revolutions, but I will carry on trying to make a small difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By trying to be a role model for anyone who can relate to me, whatever their colour, gender, or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being visible as a woman techie, who does woman techie things, who&amp;rsquo;s also a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By calling out (quietly and personally, at least at first) where I see things that might give the wrong message: e.g.
e-mailing conference organisers to point out they only have white men in their line up; private messaging people to
let them know their comments could be taken the wrong way; pointing out to user group leaders that their meetup
page shows only men at their events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By continuing to give an honest view of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a female Java developer, especially if these
experiences are different to those of other women - one woman&amp;rsquo;s view does not represent every woman&amp;rsquo;s view, if more
of us tell our different tales, we have a better view of the whole ecosystem (and its inhabitants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By sharing not only the negatives, but the many positives of working in such a varied and rapidly changing profession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am tired of fighting, however tiny my efforts are. But I&amp;rsquo;m more tired of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The State of Java</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we
find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please,
DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us
an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to use Java 8 in real life, so this could not have been better timed - I got to ask the guys a bunch
of questions about the intentions behind some of the Java 8 features, and the current vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/trishagee/2015-java-update-and-roadmap-jug-sevilla&#34; title=&#34;2015 Java update and roadmap, JUG sevilla&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2015 Java update and roadmap, JUG sevilla&lt;/a&gt; from Georges Saab and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notes from the session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/a&gt; could be just a syntax change,
but they could be more than that - they could impact the language, the libraries
and the JVM. They could have a positive impact on performance, and this work can continue to go on through small
updates to Java that don&amp;rsquo;t impact the syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; are a pipeline of operations, made possible/easier/more readable by lambdas. The aim is to make operations
on collections easier and more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Old World Order, you had to care about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to perform certain operations. With streams, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to
tell the computer exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done, you can simply say what operations you want performed. This makes it easier
for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streams will take all the operations you pass in and perform them in a single pass of the data, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have
to write multiple loops to perform multiple operations on the same data structure, or tie your brain in knots figuring
out how to do it in one loop. There are also no intermediate data structures when you use streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation
can be optimised under the covers (e.g. not performing the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; operation if the data is already ordered correctly),
and the developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. Java can introduce further optimisations in later releases without
changing the API or impacting the code a developer has already written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These new features in Java have a focus on readability, since code is much more often read than written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations are easier to parallelise, because the developer is no longer dictating the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; - multiple &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops
might not be easy to parallelise, but a series of operations can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html&#34;&gt;Default methods&lt;/a&gt; and
new support for &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html#static&#34;&gt;static methods on interfaces&lt;/a&gt; are interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten you could put static methods on interfaces and I&amp;rsquo;m going to sneak them into my latest project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html&#34;&gt;Nashorn&lt;/a&gt; is here to replace Rhino. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in the sort of environment that would need server-side
JavaScript so this whole area has passed me by somewhat, but seems it might be interesting for Node.js or creating
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&#34;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt;
in JavaScript that you want to run on the JVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_s_new_type&#34;&gt;additional annotation support in Java 8&lt;/a&gt;
will be useful for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;Java EE&lt;/a&gt;.  As this is something I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing
with (specifically web sockets) I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this, but it seems like it will be a while before this filters into
the Java EE that&amp;rsquo;s used on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html&#34;&gt;Mission Control and Flight Recorder&lt;/a&gt; - look interesting.  Feel like I should play with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are skipping straight from Java 6 to 8 - the new language features and improved performance are major driving
factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml&#34;&gt;End of public updates of Java 7 in April&lt;/a&gt;. Having libraries that, um&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; adoption of the latest version of
Java makes life a lot easier for those who develop the Java language, as they can concentrate on moving the language
forward and not be tied down supporting old versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaDB&lt;/a&gt;,
or my memory has completely discarded it. I had no idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9&lt;/a&gt; is well under way, check out the JEPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1&#34;&gt;JEP process&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/&#34;&gt;Jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; was explained, and actually I could see myself using it for the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now. I had a look
to see if I could use it via the OpenJDK, but it looks like the groundwork is there, but not the actual modules themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/g1-intro-jsp-135488.html&#34;&gt;G1 Garbage Collector&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the go forward GC&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s the one that&amp;rsquo;s being actively worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193&#34;&gt;Enhanced Volatiles&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m so behind the times!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to internal packages is going away in Java 9. So
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t use any &lt;code&gt;sun.*&lt;/code&gt; packages&lt;/a&gt;.
Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.dzone.com/articles/jdeps-jdk-8-command-line&#34;&gt;jdeps&lt;/a&gt; to identify any
dependencies in your code that need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and, looking further ahead than Java 9, we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/&#34;&gt;Project Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/&#34;&gt;REPL for Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;possibly a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/198&#34;&gt;lightweight JSON API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~psandoz/varhandles/jvmls14-varHandles.pdf&#34;&gt;VarHandles&lt;/a&gt; were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the guys mentioned a &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/2y5Pv4yN0b0&#34;&gt;talk by Brian Goetz called &amp;ldquo;Stewardship: the Sobering Parts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which has gone onto my
to-watch list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;ideas:aa7b1625222cbc3d2fec1ade4af1aaa0&#34;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear throughout the talk there are plenty of ideas that we could explore in later presentations.  If you want to see
any of the following, add a comment or ping me or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or Meetup and we&amp;rsquo;ll try and schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you can present on any of these topics and want to come to a beautiful, sunny city with amazing food to
do so, drop me a line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JCP, the purpose, the processes, the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a JSR, Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Date/Time (JSR310)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code optimisation vs Data optimisation (I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what this means, but I wrote it down in my notes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java EE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;further-reading:aa7b1625222cbc3d2fec1ade4af1aaa0&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370772/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449370772&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=GGWNXKE672H3G2FY&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&amp;rsquo;s Lambdas and Streams&lt;/a&gt; book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617291994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1617291994&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=KDGWBWOK2S6FVS6F&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Action&lt;/a&gt; has details on other Java 8 features like Date and Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321927761/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321927761&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=7VJH32FI5ZVEDOMW&#34;&gt;Java 8 for the Really Impatient&lt;/a&gt; covers JavaFX too, and highlights some Java 7 features you might like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Goetz did a great talk last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLksirK9nnE&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lambdas in Java: A peek under the hood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I had to watch it twice before even half of the info sank in, but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Colebourne, the guy behind Joda time and the new Date and Time API, has &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/87157763&#34;&gt;this talk about the new API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9 OpenJDK page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Part 2</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij&#34;&gt;last post about IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt;, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know.  And this is all just in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigate-between-methods:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Navigate between methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I knew you could use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-2.Structure&#34;&gt;structure thingie&lt;/a&gt;
(Ctrl+F12) to let you navigate to methods in your class (although I never actually
use it, it somehow never sticks in my head).  What I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-5.Navigatebetweenmethods&#34;&gt;jump between methods&lt;/a&gt;
using Alt+Up/Down arrows.  This strikes me as being super useful, especially to browse tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;refactoring-string-fragments:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Refactoring String Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted this feature so many times, but could never find it or get it to work - did you know you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-4.Stringfragments&#34;&gt;refactor out parts of a
hardcoded string&lt;/a&gt;
into variable/field/constant? Select the section of the String you want to extract, and use the normal &amp;ldquo;Extract&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
shortcuts - e.g. Ctrl+Alt+V to extract it into a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it and it does!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;invert-boolean:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Invert Boolean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a keyboard shortcut mapped by default, but using &amp;ldquo;Refactor -&amp;gt; Invert Boolean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (or using
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/index.html#toc_0&#34;&gt;our newly discovered&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; shortcut of Shift+Ctrl+A and typing &amp;ldquo;Invert&amp;rdquo;) you can tell IntelliJ you want
a boolean field to mean the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; thing, and it will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-6.Invertboolean&#34;&gt;flip the meaning everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, you might have an &lt;code&gt;saved&lt;/code&gt; flag, and you now want it to mean &lt;code&gt;notSaved&lt;/code&gt; - IntelliJ will make sure the
&lt;code&gt;isSaved&lt;/code&gt; method returns &lt;code&gt;!notSaved&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;magic-refactor-suggestions:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Magic Refactor Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t always know exactly what refactoring operation you want to perform, and IntelliJ is ready to help - it can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-10.Refactorthis&#34;&gt;suggest refactorings available in the current context&lt;/a&gt;
using the catchy magic incantation Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T.  Seems useful, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m not going to remember that
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlight-implemented-overridden-methods:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Highlight implemented/overridden methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love everything about IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to find usages of things - finding where methods are called, finding
implementations of a method, highlighting usages of a field, method or variable&amp;hellip; What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Find+Usages#FindUsages-6.Highlightimplementedandoverriddenmethods&#34;&gt;highlight the methods that implement or override a specific interface or superclass&lt;/a&gt;.
For some people, this might not add much, as your little &amp;ldquo;I override something&amp;rdquo; icon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/override.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; title=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;combined with the &lt;code&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; annotation, might tell you all you need to know. But that only really works if you&amp;rsquo;re implementing a
a single interface.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve correctly separated your concerns, you might implement several interfaces, and want to know
which are the methods from a particular one.  That&amp;rsquo;s where Shift+Ctrl+F7 on the &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; keyword comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-individual-inspection-by-name:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Run individual inspection by name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections&#34;&gt;inspections&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot.  They&amp;rsquo;re especially
useful if you have a codebase that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite conform to your ideal standards, so you can&amp;rsquo;t yet turn on automated
checks like checkstyle to break the build when the code doesn&amp;rsquo;t
conform - there&amp;rsquo;s an initial step where first you need to clean up the code.  Inspections are great, because you can
have IntelliJ give you little yellow marks to show where things are suboptimal, and aim to check in only files without
little yellow marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-6.Runasingleinspection&#34;&gt;run a single inspection&lt;/a&gt;
on files in any scope.  So if, for example, you wanted to
make sure that the code you&amp;rsquo;ve touched in this change has no unused bits, like
unused parameters or unused/untested methods, you could press Shift+Alt+Ctrl+I and type &amp;ldquo;unused&amp;rdquo;. Select the
&amp;ldquo;Unused Declaration&amp;rdquo; inspection and choose to run this on all uncommitted files.  This will tell you where you can
clean up your code, and every commit should make your codebase that little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;saving-power-with-highlighting:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Saving Power With Highlighting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know you could easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-7.Highlightinglevelandpowersavemode&#34;&gt;alter the active errors/warnings&lt;/a&gt;,
and use that to save power.  Quite Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;auto-indent-your-lines:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Auto indent your lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost obsessively reformat my code as I go, pressing &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-1.Reformatcode&#34;&gt;Ctrl+Alt+L&lt;/a&gt;
almost like a muscle twitch. What I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, though, is that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-2.Autoindentlines&#34;&gt;shortcut which will just fix the line
indentation&lt;/a&gt;,
which is probably 80% of what I need anyway - Ctrl+Alt+I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fix-evil-string-concatenation:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Fix Evil String Concatenation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this one earlier - do you know how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve gone around and manually changed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&amp;quot;This thing &amp;quot; + something + &amp;quot; is &amp;quot; + somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.printf(&amp;quot;This thing %s is %s%n&amp;quot;, something, somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you??? Anyway you don&amp;rsquo;t need to - Alt+Enter inside the params &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Intentions#Intentions-2.Stringconcatenation&#34;&gt;will suggest the replacement and do it for
you&lt;/a&gt;. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vcs-quick-access:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;VCS Quick Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t use IntelliJ to the best of its abilities is the Git integration.  I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/&#34;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; combined with IntelliJ to do most of my VCS management
(I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m just not a command line
person, I need to actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it). With the new laptop, I haven&amp;rsquo;t installed SourceTree yet and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and
do everything via the IDE.  Previously I used the right-click menu mostly for managing VCS operations, occasionally the
VCS menu, and did most stuff in the &amp;ldquo;Changes&amp;rdquo; window.  But now I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Alt+&amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; (Ctrl+V on the mac) to
bring up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Version+Control+Basics#VersionControlBasics-4.VCSoperationsquicklist&#34;&gt;menu of git-shaped operations for this
context&lt;/a&gt;.
To stop you having to hunt all over the keyboard to
find what on earth a &amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; is, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#96;, which on both my UK and US (Windows) keyboards is in the top left
corner of your keyboard (on the Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s on the bottom left next to the shift, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it since your
shortcut is different anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;amend-commits:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Amend Commits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered that you can commit a change which smushes up into your last commit and fixes it.  I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it commits the
new changes and (potentially) an updated commit message into the last change.  I really wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this
earlier, on a number of occasions in the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve done this either manually or by doing a rather
dangerous soft reset.  I will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be using this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/amend-commit.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; title=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cursor-as-a-breakpoint:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;The Cursor as a Breakpoint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Debugger#Debugger-5.Runtocursor&#34;&gt;use the cursor as a temporary breakpoint&lt;/a&gt;?
I did not.  Well, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;labelling-changes:c33c28c3818118510a814dfc68ca3ba2&#34;&gt;Labelling Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope by now none of us developers are doing that icky thing of having &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/529299964787449856&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Copy of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Backup of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; filenames
and directories&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of our versions.  We&amp;rsquo;re all using a VCS of course.  But if you&amp;rsquo;re being strict about making
sure that every commit leads to a working build (we all do that, right&amp;hellip;?) then sometimes even distributed file systems
like git, with its local branches, are too heavyweight for experiments and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ has Local History, which I personally think you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rely on, but has occasionally saved my bacon in
times of strife.  It also does this really nice thing (automatically) where it labels versions where the tests passed,
so you&amp;rsquo;ve got some level of confidence that at that point in time, at that revision, things weren&amp;rsquo;t hideously broken.
At the very least, they must have compiled.  What I did not know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Local+History#LocalHistory-6.Putlabel&#34;&gt;add your own labels&lt;/a&gt;, so you could
label some local, non-committed version of the file as &amp;ldquo;feature x works but y doesn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; (or probably something much
shorter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it looks useful. As I say though, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement for VCS, but a suppliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
So, that&amp;rsquo;s the end of Week One at JetBrains, and already I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole heap of things.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;rsquo;s more to
come, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Today</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Day three of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures&#34;&gt;brand new job&lt;/a&gt; - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&amp;rsquo;m
already a &amp;ldquo;Power User&amp;rdquo;, to see if there&amp;rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; read it.  Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously known,
and they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s today&amp;rsquo;s list, and feel free to laugh at me and be smug in my direction if you already knew these things (note: I
have upgraded to IntelliJ 14, and at the time of writing I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of these features are new and which are
simply previously undiscovered):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigate-directly-to-an-action-or-option:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Navigate directly to an action or option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Cmd+A (Mac) and start typing the name of the thing you want to do, or the setting
you want to change. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this especially useful now I&amp;rsquo;m back on Windows and I don&amp;rsquo;t have that nice helpful typing
box on the help menu that will take me straight to the menu item I want.  But what&amp;rsquo;s most useful about this for me today,
as I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a new profile on a new laptop (more on the new laptop later, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t defeat me utterly) is that
from here, you can turn various settings on and off without having to navigate through the settings screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/action.png&#34; alt=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; title=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;statement-completion:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Statement completion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew there was a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-4.Statementcompletion&#34;&gt;shortcut for finishing off a statement&lt;/a&gt;,
all that Java boilerplate you need to keep the compiler happy - semi colons and curly brackets and everything.  But
there is, and I can see it being super useful, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using other bits of IntelliJ code completion to
create the core of your line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issue-tracker-integration:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Issue tracker integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure loads of people are already using integration with their favourite issue tracker, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought
about this as something that I really cared about.  But I was watching the intro videos for YouTrack (not surprisingly
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this instead of Jira during my time at JetBrains) and when I saw
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2_3Y1jLm5U&#34;&gt;how the IDE integration worked&lt;/a&gt;, I
suddenly realised how this small thing can add up to save thousands of keystrokes over time, not to mention saving
precious navigational seconds and window-switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, just the ability to generate at least the start of the commit message is a saving in time, and adds to project
consistency if all your developers are doing the same thing.  On my last project we only just realised we all quoted the
Jira issues in subtly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;settings-shortcut-keys:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Settings shortcut keys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I initially started using IntelliJ in anger back in 2008, I was very much a point-and-click type user. Over time,
pair programming with keyboard-super-users and giving live demos with very limited time available, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked harder
to become a keyboard-shortcuts person.  With the latest version of IntelliJ, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the tiny icons I use to get to
the settings window, something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot as I set up the new IDE instance on the new laptop.  So I bit
the bullet and learnt the keyboard shortcuts, and it&amp;rsquo;s already saving me a bunch of time (on the rare occasions when the
aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; fails me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ctrl+Alt+S for the settings dialog (appears to be Cmd + , on the Mac)
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+S for the project structure dialog (appears to be Cmd + ; on the Mac)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; title=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t already using those either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selecting-the-negative:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Selecting the negative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use completion/suggestions all the time from IntelliJ, I&amp;rsquo;m far too lazy to type everything.  What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise, is
that you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to accept the default they give you.  If, for example, IntelliJ suggests a boolean value, you
can get it to negate that value by selecting it with &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; instead of enter or tab.  Yes, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a horrible job
of explaining that, but take a look at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-5.Negatingcompletion&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
and try it, it&amp;rsquo;s quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exclude-from-autocomplete:41c959bf685955ca610a9171f62da81b&#34;&gt;Exclude from Autocomplete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code completion, sometimes IntelliJ is sometimes just a bit too keen to suggest something, and you really
will never want that value.  In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Auto Import&lt;/code&gt; to manage the
suggestions (the most common one for me is I will never want &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;, I will almost always want
&lt;code&gt;java.util.List&lt;/code&gt;).  Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into settings to do this, you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-9.Excludefromcompletion&#34;&gt;do it from the suggestions themselves&lt;/a&gt; -
navigate to the item you don&amp;rsquo;t want (in my case, &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;) and press Alt+Enter, this will give you the option
of excluding this from the suggestions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I found from just one day of browsing the documentation and setting up my IDE from scratch yet again.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll promptly forget all these, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll be new weapons in my armoury of IDE-fu. Either way, maybe one or
two people will find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Year, New Adventures</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just over two years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/post/and_for_my_next_trick/&#34;&gt;I embarked upon a journey&lt;/a&gt; as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then
called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB Inc&lt;/a&gt;). My goals for
this role were: to learn what it was
like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to
level up my advocacy skills.  I have met all these goals, and more - I met some fantastic people; learnt different approaches to
software development; discovered my new favourite database for creating applications; moved to Spain; started both a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;;
worked to understand the value of community and evangelism, and to help create a strategy for these areas;
and my evangelism efforts and open source work earned me the &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/website/java-champions/bios.html#Gee&#34;&gt;Java Champion&lt;/a&gt; title.
I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved over this period, and very grateful to MongoDB for giving me these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, a new adventure is about to begin.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen my &lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt;
this year, you&amp;rsquo;ll know of my love affair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;,
a tool I use daily (even for blogging). Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
where I&amp;rsquo;m going Full Advocate. I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; this means I get to carry on doing more of what I love - presenting, writing,
and working on demos to help developers become more productive. I hope this will give me opportunities to stay ahead of the curve in the
Java/JVM world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yes, in answer to the Most Frequently Asked Question, I am staying in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Sevilla and I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to
leave yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/Sevilla.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall leave you with my somewhat disasterous &amp;ldquo;Top Ten IntelliJ Tips&amp;rdquo; from GOTO Aarhus, which is worth watching just to see Dan North
save me from the curse of the live demo.  Things can only get better from here, right?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
      <link>http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <author>Trisha Gee</author>
      <guid>http://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically,
although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem,
only identify some issues and explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&amp;rsquo;t post it now I&amp;rsquo;ll never post it, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and
posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;firstly-what-stops-people-from-stepping-up-to-speak:1af3fe33f6e93bedb196a85f5a451c5d&#34;&gt;Firstly, what stops people from stepping up to speak?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the very first thing any developer says when you ask them why they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about presenting at conferences or user
groups. Turns out, you always have something to say.  For example, our most popular sessions at the Sevilla JUG and MUG are &amp;ldquo;Introduction
 to&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;. You hear from plenty of experts who have travelled the whole road to some pinnacle of excellence,
 but what many developers need is simply someone a couple of steps ahead of them to lead them forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always know more than &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more than everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I be role model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So many women feel this, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely sympathetic to this view point: I&amp;rsquo;m a woman developer, getting along, happy in my job,
happy being a programmer, why the hell should I have to stand up and present and blog and be a role model for other women? Men don&amp;rsquo;t have
to do that. Men can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the fear that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand up, become a role model, that somehow people will think you&amp;rsquo;re representing all
women developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll be worried because you can only represent who you are, what you do, you can&amp;rsquo;t represent a whole gender in a
single presentation or a single interview.  And the pressure! What if I mess up? What if I say something my gender does not agree with?
What if I say something that causes my whole gender to be judged?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally understandable fears. Totally true that many people will ask you to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; woman developer, to answer for all women.  Well,
that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking more women to stand up, to be role models - if we all step up, it will no longer just be me, and you,
and that other one over there. There&amp;rsquo;ll be more of us, more differing voices, we&amp;rsquo;ll stand out less. But we have to stand up first.  And
in the meantime it&amp;rsquo;s us and our points of view they&amp;rsquo;re listening to. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you rather voice your opinion than have someone else speak
on your behalf? Especially when very few people really can represent you, who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at what you do know, so people who present run into this less than you&amp;rsquo;d think, even if you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning,
but just in case here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the question, paraphrasing. Firstly, this ensures you&amp;rsquo;ve actually heard the question correctly. Secondly,
it allows the whole audience to hear it, and thirdly, but most importantly, it buys you time to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest - say you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and move on. If you know somewhere that might have the answer,
point the person to that resource.  But a technical audience actually values the answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; more than you think. Especially
the person who asked the question, it makes them feel really smart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, but you think the audience might know, throw it back to them. Either to the person who asked the question,
if that feels appropriate (especially if this is one of those &amp;ldquo;look how smart I am&amp;rdquo; questions),
or to the audience as a whole. In conferences in particular, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance someone there knows the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re genuinely terrified of all questions, say at the start of the presentation that you won&amp;rsquo;t take questions in the talk. Offer
an alternative, like via Twitter or e-mail, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-conference-organisers-do:1af3fe33f6e93bedb196a85f5a451c5d&#34;&gt;What can conference organisers do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically invite the people you want presenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t just wait for them to submit. If you want more women, more diversity, invite them. And invite them early&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your women presenters early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recognise that there are relatively few women presenters on &amp;ldquo;the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and understand that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants them to speak at their
conference. This rare breed, the female technical presenter, gets booked up &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; in advance.  They&amp;rsquo;re probably as in-demand as your
keynote speakers, and can probably devote less time to appearing at conferences than those who have made it to keynote-standard (I&amp;rsquo;m
making a sweeping generalisation that your techy women have day-jobs as developers and your keynote speakers are either professional
presenters or at least can argue presenting as a critical part of their job).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have a limited resource (experienced women presenters) that&amp;rsquo;s in high demand. You need to reach out directly to them,
invite them, and secure them well in advance of your conference.  Many big conferences, for example JavaOne and QCon,
will invite speakers six months in advance. If you give women speakers a month&amp;rsquo;s notice before your conference or event,
they simply are not going to have the space in their schedule at that late notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showcase your diversity on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory&#34;&gt;microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;,
go and read what that means before you get any further.  There&amp;rsquo;s a very simple thing you
need to do with your website, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve opened for CFP or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get attendees to register - make sure the photos on your
website show the type of diversity you want to encourage.  Only yesterday I was looking at the website of a big conference,
who I know for a fact are working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to ensure diversity, not just with gender but race, age,
and where possible in less physically obvious dimensions. The conference is many months off, so the only photo they have on the website
is a background photo of the exhibition hall from some previous year, crammed full of attendees - white, male attendees,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to tell.  It&amp;rsquo;s extremely subtle. You might not even notice, as the photo is behind the headers and text of the
site. But I noticed. And you can be sure the subconscious of every person who went to the website to either submit a proposal for a
talk, or is considering asking their employer to pay for the registration, also noticed.  The conscious mind might be able to shrug it
off.  But the subconscious of a non-white and/or non-male person notices and plants the subtle seed
of &amp;ldquo;this conference is not for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conference and event organisers - if you want more women applying to speak at your conference,
show more women on your website.  If you want a more diverse audience, show more diverse faces.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve invited your women presenters
early and secured them early, show their photos on the site - this sends a strong message to other women that their talk proposals will be
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run warm up nights to try out new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know conference organisers get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of submissions, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which are going to be good speakers,
especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new speakers or don&amp;rsquo;t have a video.  If you&amp;rsquo;re genuine about improving the diversity of your speakers,
run free nights to a) promote your conference and b) try out new speakers.  Probably a good idea to have a new speaker and a known
speaker to attract the crowd and give newbies a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so damn picky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New speakers need to be encouraged. Find a way to see their content without just discarding an unknown name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing speakers might not have the luxury of creating new content. Many conferences want genuine practitioners,
not just evangelists, but those people have day jobs and can&amp;rsquo;t be creating a new talk just for your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave space for new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;and don&amp;rsquo;t just have 7 slots for a pro speaker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not just guys t-shirts.  One conference gave out cupcakes for example. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be handbags and high-heeled shoes,
just take a quick look and see if your swag is generally useful for techies, or if it leans towards men only. Men only swag (men&amp;rsquo;s
t-shirts, bottle openers, subtle things like that) subliminally says &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t belong here&amp;rdquo; to the women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell every individual why they were rejected, but you could look at all the rejected submissions and give broad indications of
the type of CFPs that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Maybe write a blog post explaining which sorts of talks didn&amp;rsquo;t make it and why.  This will help
speakers create content that better fits your conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be specific about what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have tracks you&amp;rsquo;re finding content for, put them on the website/CFP, so people know what the topics are. If you have an
idea that you want 30% beginner material and 30% very advanced, make that clear too. Especially if you want &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; beginner or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
advanced. People will submit more appropriate talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip;not just for the speakers, for the content too. Beginner speakers may be more comfortable presenting &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; talks.&lt;br /&gt;
Having a beginners track, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for content or speakers, will make newbies feel more included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-other-things-can-we-try:1af3fe33f6e93bedb196a85f5a451c5d&#34;&gt;What other things can we try?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User groups can grow talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice writing CFPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning talks, book club, different meetup styles (like fishbowl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an open conference to encourage new speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s user groups are instrumental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So here&amp;rsquo;s something interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sceptical of all-women user groups as I feel it separates us from the communities we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
contributing to. But women&amp;rsquo;s user groups can help us to integrate better.  For example, Duchess France helped and encouraged its members
to submit talks to Devoxx, gave feedback on CFPs before they were submitted, and provided a safe place for the women to practice
presenting beforehand.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing women&amp;rsquo;s user groups could be fantastic for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;advice-for-budding-speakers:1af3fe33f6e93bedb196a85f5a451c5d&#34;&gt;Advice for budding speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Do It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you do it, the more comfortable you&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker, it can make you feel less of an impostor at a conference - you&amp;rsquo;re not just a woman developer, you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s afraid, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer wants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience is on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Small (user groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be technical. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be super smart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping is hard - you haven&amp;rsquo;t presented so you can&amp;rsquo;t get into conferences. Again, user groups can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair. Ask a more experienced presenter if you can co-present with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate there is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more I could have covered, and many topics deserve more depth. But this is the brain dump from the Devoxx
session, and maybe one day things will be expanded into their own topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&#39;s not waste, it&#39;s learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one my my rare weekends at home, I found myself on a pottery course (this is the sort of thing that happens when you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; title=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time on the course, there was something enormously satisfactory and therapeutic about working with my hands,
on something creative that was for me, and only me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My first bowl&#34; title=&#34;My first bowl&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Honestly, I think the one I did in primary school when I was seven was better.&lt;br /&gt;
And I don&amp;rsquo;t care, because I loved creating it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really struck me that day was embracing failure and destruction as part of the creative process.  Let me give you a
couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teacher showed us several techniques for creating pottery, one of which was using plaster moulds and very liquid clay to produce more
complex items (for example, mugs and animal figures).  He told us that when using a new mould,
the first few items would be useless.  But these &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; are an important process for the mould itself.  The
class was in Spanish, so my understanding was imperfect, but I think it was something to do with the fact that the plaster moulds are
supposed to absorb water, and therefore I assume at the beginning they absorb far too much and the clay ends up being too dry and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; title=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;Pottery created with moulds&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example was when he showed us why it was so difficult to create a clay plate - bowls, mugs, cups were fine,
but a plate is difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s flat and the shape doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough structure for it to have any rigidity  if it&amp;rsquo;s even slightly damp
(and clay stays damp for a looong time, even in a climate like Seville&amp;rsquo;s). He demonstrated this by cutting straight through the plate
that he&amp;rsquo;d put into the mould earlier and folding it up, to the collective intake of breath of the whole class - a class of people of a range
of ages and backgrounds. We seem socially programmed to find destruction of any kind upsetting (which is probably, overall,
not a bad thing), when the teacher sliced the plate in half to demonstrate how floppy the plate was, we were all disturbed by this waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My pieces&#34; title=&#34;My pieces&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Even when I broke my bowl when preparing it for the kiln, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to abandon it - I turned it into a
candle holder&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing - it&amp;rsquo;s clay.  Clay is mud.  It&amp;rsquo;s from the ground.  Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s almost completely reusable.  All of the leftover
clay from our earlier exercises, all of the excess liquid clay from the moulds, all of the pieces that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it,
it was put aside and saved for later.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a waste.  It&amp;rsquo;s learning.  It&amp;rsquo;s experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking.  If we can be like that about something concrete, something that exists in the real world,
why aren&amp;rsquo;t we like that about something as ephemeral as code?  Why are we so afraid to throw away code? And don&amp;rsquo;t tell me we&amp;rsquo;re not
afraid - how many &amp;ldquo;spikes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prototypes&amp;rdquo; have you seen running in production?  Have you read people talking about
creating code and throwing it away, and thought &amp;ldquo;that sounds nice, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to just producing useful code&amp;rdquo;? (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not
talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&#34;&gt;throwing away perfectly good production code&lt;/a&gt;,
nor am I talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://codesqueeze.com/refactorbation/&#34;&gt;refactorbation&lt;/a&gt;, a term I just discovered and love.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating for research, spikes, learning etc, and then throwing it away).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Java&#34; title=&#34;Java&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;What?? I needed to carve something into the medallion&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=5KXFITDLKQQCXD3K&#34;&gt;Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1477800670&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;,
and there&amp;rsquo;s a section in there that talks about getting into the habit of
creating just for the sake of creating.  Not for your side projects, not for a client, not even for your portfolio.  Simply to get into
the habit of creating.  &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; some of those ideas, or processes, will come in handy later down the line.  Or maybe,
like the clay moulds, simply creating something for throwing away actually helps the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences have left me with a feeling that I should start getting used to the idea of throwing code away,
and start creating things for no reason other than the feeling of creating.  It could be like running - in theory I run so I have to
worry less about my weight and my fitness, but actually I run &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more frequently when I run just for the joy of running. The fitness
and health are side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re so reluctant to throw code away precisely because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ephemeral.  Maybe with the clay,
we can see that concrete thing, that mud, being turned into something useful eventually.  With running,
you can feel the difference in your attitude, in your fitness, maybe see it on the scales. With code, when you delete those characters,
revert that change, you feel like you lost something, and have nothing to show for that precious time.  When actually you created new
pathways in your brain, added new memories and learnt new lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready yet to create just for the sake of creating, I think I&amp;rsquo;m just too results-driven. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to
write about it here to remind myself that it is something I want to do. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the exercise, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The full haul&#34; title=&#34;The full haul&#34; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The final pieces, still needing the kiln to finish the glaze.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
