      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right so yes. 2020, hello. One of my 2020 resolutions is to get back to my personal blog. Weekly. Yeah right. Let&#39;s
aim for weekly and be happy with monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first post let&#39;s do the obligatory look-back-over-last-year. Not because it&#39;s trendy (I&#39;m 41 now, I don&#39;t care
about
being trendy any more), but because it&#39;s super important for me to understand what I went through and what I
achieved last year (every year), otherwise I get caught up in the hamster-wheel 
of the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing. Progress should be celebrated, not just ignored for the next item on the ever
growing, ever pressing TODO list. Also, looking back helps me to plan the next year. 
Doesn&#39;t have to be super-planned, but setting some goals, objectives, ideas for which direction I&#39;d prefer to go in helps me decide how to
prioritise that ever-growing, ever-pressing TODO list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Me Mum</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/me_mum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&#39;t see what an enormous impact Mum made on my life, because she was always there. There&#39;s a quote in the book
Good Omens: &amp;ldquo;It&#39;s for the same reason you can&#39;t see England when you&#39;re in Trafalgar Square&amp;rdquo; - Mum was a constant, 
important, dependable presence for my whole life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote something for Mum while I was on the plane from Spain to spend what was to be our last two weeks together. 
I&#39;d like to share some of that with you all now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This July my Mum passed away, apparently cancer was the one opponent she couldn&#39;t beat in an argument. Mum had a huge
impact on my life, as you might expect, not only personally but professionally too. Maybe I&#39;ll talk about that some
more in time.  For now, I want to publish the poem my very talented cousin Izzi Giles wrote in tribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Code Review Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/code_review_best_practices/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fogbugz.com/blog/code-review-best-practices/&#34;&gt;guest post for FogBugz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find bugs and security issues early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the readability of our code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick guide to help you to create an effective code review process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaker Tips - Focus on Either Content or Delivery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re a new speaker, or just starting to consider speaking at conferences or user groups 
for the first time, it&#39;s easy to become overwhelmed by all the things you worry 
about when delivering a talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaker Tips - What to Wear</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_what_to_wear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I&#39;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&#39;t want to cover it because I 
didn&#39;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&#39;t want other 
women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&#39;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking
long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&#39;s not how everyone works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaker Tips - Wearing a Roaming Mic is More Complicated Than I Realised</title>

      <description>I realise I have a bunch of experience and advice for speakers and potential speakers that I simply haven&#39;t written down or shared. Here&#39;s the first piece on things to consider that you might not have thought about.
Note: as usual, my advice is from the point of view of a woman (me) and is aimed mostly at women, but also as usual it&#39;s probably useful for others to know too.</description>

      <title>What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</guid>
      <description>Now I&#39;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to present at a lot of conferences. Obviously all these conferences are mostly interested in my terribly educational talks, but it&#39;s also because I&#39;m a technical woman and there aren&#39;t very many technical women speaking at conferences.
In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees.</description>

      <title>Being a Developer Advocate at JetBrains</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_job/</link>

      <description>Mandatory initial exclamation about how little I have blogged here lately. Over a year without updates, oh dear! But a) I have been blogging quite a lot for the IntelliJ IDEA and Upsource blogs, and b) I had another baby, which kept me quite busy.
So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&#39;s involved in the job, what&#39;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&#39;s it like working remotely etc etc.</description>

      <description>So, I wrote a long email to the London Java Community in answer to an excellent question: &amp;ldquo;What can men do to support Women in Technology?&amp;quot;.
It&#39;s a bit of a brain dump, by no means comprehensive, and is in answer to a specific question in a specific context, but I&#39;ve been asked to make the information public so it can be useful in a broader context. So here it is.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been a while since I wrote a conference write up. The short version of &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; is because I got a bit bored of doing it. Plus, I found I was attending conferences as a speaker &amp;ldquo;on the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting to other attendees to see what they&#39;re up to and so forth, didn&#39;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out whether a conference is worth attending from a content or atmosphere point of view.</description>

      <title>A Year? Really?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</guid>
      <description>So I came to the blog to update my upcoming events (at least something stays up to date) only to find it&#39;s been nearly a year since I last blogged! This is terrible!
It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t written anything in a year, it&#39;s that a lot of my writing energy goes into stuff for the actual day job. Which is good, because that&#39;s pretty much what I wanted from the day job, but the blog makes it look like I don&#39;t write any more.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the final get-together to discuss the

event hosted in August in a city that is regularly over 40°C is going to face challenges, so it was great that 
we had attendees from earlier sessions plus new people too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; 
is working towards completing the

lambdas and streams. We&#39;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
to share knowledge between people who are doing the course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post for the JetBrains Upsource blog about some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/07/23/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review/&#34;&gt;things you should be looking for when you do code

you should not be looking at).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

during the course so we can, as a group, ask  questions about the lectures, get help with the homework, and (if we&#39;re
feeling very smart!) help people who may be struggling (or might not have watched the videos).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interviewed by InfoQ</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at QCon New York (probably my business conference this year!) I was 
interviewed by Ralph Winzinger for InfoQ. It felt like a short interview at the time, 
but we covered a lot of ground - Java 8, Java vs other JVM languages, the effectiveness
of the JCP, and the future of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video and the transcript are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-java-eco-system&#34;&gt;available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I get asked a lot about how I got into technical advocacy / 
evangelism&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, 
so it seems like the most cost-effective way to answer this question is to 
write a post about it. Warning: it&#39;s a long one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them. I could claim lack of time, but the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading that, but I get bored of writing it.</description>

around blind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/&#34;&gt;CFPs&lt;/a&gt; (Call For Papers - usually to get into a conference you submit to a CFP) for 
conferences. I often hear it said that a blind CFP will fix, or at least improve, the diversity imbalance at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t believe this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We work so hard to promote equality, to fight for the rights of people who are not middle-class 
white men, and time and again it just feels like we&#39;re not getting anywhere.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internationalwomensday.com/&#34;&gt;International Women&#39;s 
Day&lt;/a&gt; highlights the issues that face women all around the world, and make our 
women-in-tech problem 
look like a genuine &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems&#34;&gt;First World Problem&lt;/a&gt;, and yet we can&#39;t even get that right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we
find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please,
DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us
an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&#39;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I&#39;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij&#34;&gt;last post about IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt;, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&#39;t know.  And this is all just in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s the next batch (although once again I&#39;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Today</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day three of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures&#34;&gt;brand new job&lt;/a&gt; - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&#39;m
already a &amp;ldquo;Power User&amp;rdquo;, to see if there&#39;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; read it.  Of course, I&#39;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&#39;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;ll tell you what, today I&#39;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&#39;t previously known,
and they&#39;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&#39;t know was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

about how developers aren&#39;t just communing with the computer, they also need to feel listened to by real human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.</description>

      <description>Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&#39;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&#39;t post it now I&#39;ll never post it, and it&#39;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.</description>

      <description>This year I&#39;ve been demonstrating how easy it is to create modern web apps using AngularJS, Java and MongoDB. I also use Groovy during this demo to do the sorts of things Groovy is really good at - writing descriptive tests, and creating scripts.
Due to the time pressures in the demo, I never really get a chance to go into the details of the script I use, so the aim of this long-overdue blog post is to go over this Groovy script in a bit more detail.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MongoDB and Java</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/getting_started_with_mongodb_and_java/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/getting_started_with_mongodb_and_java/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been missing an introduction to using MongoDB from Java for a little while now - there&#39;s plenty of information in &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;the 
documentation&lt;/a&gt;, but we were lacking a step-by-step guide to getting started as a Java 
developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to rectify this with a couple of blog posts for the MongoDB official blog: the first, an introduction to using MongoDB from 
Java, including a non-comprehensive list of some of the libraries you can use; the second, an introductory guide to simple CRUD 
operations using the Java driver:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It nicely describes how it feels to be marginalised and not quite &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;. But there are some things that I&#39;d like to

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I walked into the kitchen to see how lunch was going and my boyfriend handed me a knife, 
a part-chopped hard boiled egg and said &amp;ldquo;finish this, I need to have a shower&amp;rdquo;. As you do. Apparently there were two things that needed 
doing - &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; needed finishing, and I needed to keep an eye on the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend,

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Blogger happily for three years or so, since I migrated the blog from LiveJournal and decided to actually invest some time writing. I&#39;m happy with it because I just type stuff into Blogger and It Just Works. I&#39;m happy because I can use my Google credentials to sign in. I&#39;m happy because now I can pretend my two Google+ accounts exist for a purpose, by getting Blogger to automatically share my content there.</description>

      <description>Last night the Sevilla MUG had our March Madness event. This was our largest event yet, with 36 people signed up. Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month, that&#39;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&#39;t the main attraction - [Javier] (https://twitter.com/JvrBaena) gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at SocialBro after using MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.</description>

      <description>Web development has changed a lot.I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer. Sort of.</description>

      <description>So, following on from my observations of being an outsiderat FOSDEM because I&#39;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.I&#39;m going to give specifics, but it&#39;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&#39;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. But I&#39;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m pleased to see that GM has hired the &amp;ldquo;best person for the job&amp;rdquo; as their new CEO- that does seem like a good idea. I&#39;m happy her gender did not get in the way. What makes me uncomfortable is the international news coverage of the decision of this large manufacturer to hire a woman as their CEO - if she were a man (and/or black/gay/disabled) would the headline read &amp;ldquo;The camera loves her.</description>

      <description>Well, if I thought 2012 was the fastest disappearing year on record, that record was smashed into the ground by 2013. What a year! And because I didn&#39;t manage to write this on time to publish elsewhere, I can do a more personal reflection of the year here on my very own blog.Apparently, reading over last year&#39;s article, I had goals for 2013:Get more involved in schools/mentoring.

It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&#39;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&#39;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW!is a unique conference, in that it&#39;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.</description>

      <description>In the last two articles on Spock I&#39;ve covered mockingand stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&#39;s a killer feature: Data Driven Testing.All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&#39;s usually the path in the User Story - &amp;ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>JAX London &amp; MongoDB Tutorial</title>

      <description>In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&amp;hellip;.
But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.</description>

      <description>For no reason other than LinkedIncommunications are starting to irritate me, here&#39;s my personal LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.
 I&#39;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&#39;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.</description>

      <description>So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blogthan a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&#39;d been to.So, JavaOne, again, my third year there. I&#39;ll always have a fondness for it - because of Martin Thompson, it was the first conference I presented at.</description>

      <description>The second in my short series of blogsabout the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. In it, there&#39;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; API, or a blend of both.The post also shows that Gradleis prettier than Maven. Sorry Maven.If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&#39;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There&#39;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&#39;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&#39;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.</description>

      <description>InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&#39;s going through the interviewer&#39;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.</description>

I&#39;ve written about the design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driverin the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). I&#39;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&#39;m just linking you to them instead.Anyone who&#39;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Your App Makes Me Fat, I was going to write a blog post about decision fatigue. It&#39;s a topic very close to my heart right now as I try to plan for my upcoming speaking engagements,continue working on the new Java driver, try to finish the last couple of blogs on Spock, and last but not least plan for moving home this week.But since my cognitive resources are at a low point right now, I&#39;ll just leave you with a gif instead:What programming is like</description>

      <description>In the last postI talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spockas something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.Today I want to look at stubbing.StubbingMocking is great for checking outputs- in the example in the last post, we&#39;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.</description>

      <description>We&#39;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&#39;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&#39;ve switched to JUnit for 3.</description>

      <description>Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for GeeCON. Which was excellent! I find it really interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same.
From a speaker&#39;s point of view, there were some cultural things which took a bit of getting used to. One of the good things was that the audience was very keen on asking questions, they were much more interactive than a typical London audience (for example).</description>

I&#39;m not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?</description>

Whether you&#39;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&#39;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&#39;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&#39;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.</description>

      <description>Lets talk about mechanical sympathy. Martin Thompson has been making this term very popular in software development, so it&#39;s best to read his description of why he used the term.I had a perfect example yesterday. I&#39;m about to drive to the airport and the car won&#39;t move (I&#39;m a modern tomboy, I can write stories about hairand stories about cars). Not at all. It&#39;s stuck. I can&#39;t reverse out of my parking space.</description>

      <description>Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.
Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&#39;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&#39;t do half as much as some people).</description>

Well, I&#39;ve had my comeuppance. The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for MongoDBhas been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;:Which Java version are our users, um, using?</description>

So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. And it&#39;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&#39;ve helped build.</description>

      <description>My next few talks are where I finally start speaking about MongoDB. After 4 months working for 10gen, I still feel completely under-qualified to speak with any authority on the subject. It&#39;s very different joining a company with an established and growing product, to joining a very young company and being in on the development since practically day one. But I&#39;ve been working on designing the Brand New Java Driver, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk about.</description>

      <description>Fortunately for me, the guys at JAXenter chased me for a summary of 2012 and my predictions for 2013 - I say &amp;ldquo;fortunately&amp;rdquo; because otherwise I never would have got around to doing it, and that would be another year slipping away silently into the abyss.Here it is in all its glory.</description>

      <description>As well as talking about, you know, actual work-type-stuff, I was encouraged to give my &amp;ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&amp;rdquo; presentation at Devoxx. This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top. Also, I wasn&#39;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>If you see anything about LMAX- the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&#39;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. However, no-one&#39;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. And I realised eventually that&#39;s because I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.</description>

      <description>Hot on the heels of my very first MongoDB webinar,I was&amp;hellip; encouraged&amp;hellip; to do another. Here at 10genwe&#39;ve been running a series of webinarsaround using MongoDB in the financial services domain. Yesterday was the last in the series, and was presented in association with C24- John Davies, their CTO, did most of the talking, and demonstrated their product for automatically turning financial messages from one format into another.video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player(Slides and webinar available here- and you&#39;re not going deaf, the sound doesn&#39;t start until about 3:44 into the video)It was a fun webinar to do, actually - I didn&#39;t know anything about C24&#39;s iOtool, so I learnt quite a lot as I watched John navigate the demo.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the nerve-wrackingdubiousalarminggreat pleasure of presenting my first official MongoDB-shaped talk. This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&#39;t really. For a start, you can&#39;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.</description>

      <description>Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and got me excited about the prospects for 2013.The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&#39;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&#39;t expect to.</description>

      <description>The moral of today&#39;s story - be careful what you wish for.This is my brainDuring the normal course of my life, it&#39;s filled with Stuff.Early in November, 10gen ordered me to go to New York to learn about MongoDB(Oh No! My Life Is So Hard!). I was looking forward to shopping and taking photos of the devastation wrought by Sandy, but actually I spent the whole time drinking from the firehose of MongoDB information provided by my ridiculously smart, ridiculously well-informed colleagues.</description>

Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;ve finished my first full week in the new job and I&#39;ve learnt lots of new stuff. Which is great, because that&#39;s usually why you change jobs.I&#39;m learning a lot about these new-fangled NoSQLdatabase thingies. The LMAX architecturewas based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path. Therefore doing anything radical to the storage side of the architecture was just not high on the list of priorities.</description>

      <description>Seemed like a quiet conference this year. Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&#39;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:A great keynote from Kirk Pepperdineand Martijn Verburg, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first nightA high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&#39;s interest, but it&#39;s more likely to be a one-off)A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by Mike BarkerAnd a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.</description>

      <description>The time has come, and I&#39;m moving on from LMAX. I&#39;ve had an incredible (nearly) four years working for one of the most radical finance firms in the world, during which time I feel I&#39;ve learnt more than the rest of my work experience put together, and had the pleasure to work with some of the smartest and most interesting people I&#39;ve ever met.
I&#39;ve been invited to join 10genand their MongoDBdriver team, a challenge I am really looking forward to.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve produced a very cut down version of the presentation I&#39;ve been giving at a lot of conferences, giving a high level overview to the Disruptor. This serves as a quick intro to the concepts behind it.Introduction to the Disruptorfrom Trisha GeeMy slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&#39;t forget there&#39;s always my original blog posts (the Magic Ring Buffer, Reading from it, Writing to it, Wiring it up), which are now pretty dated, and the Java Magazinearticle I wrote at the start of the year.</description>

      <description>Yesterday dawned, with a sense of foreboding (actually it dawned with me coughing my lungs out, but we&#39;ve heard enough about the sub-optimal state of my respiratory system this week). On this day, I was giving the talk I was dreadingwhen I got asked to do it. It&#39;s the talk I actually put more work into than any of the other sessions I was presenting at this JavaOne. It was the Women In IT talk.</description>

      <description>Well this is exciting! JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&#39;ve covered the same conference two years running. I think.It&#39;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. Last yearit was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchessfolk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&#39;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.</description>

      <description>Last week (was it only last week?) I was at Strange Loop, presenting a workshop on the Disruptor.I didn&#39;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&#39;ve never been before and, if I&#39;m honest, hadn&#39;t heard of it before. So everything was a pleasant surprise.It&#39;s a very geeky conference. I mean that as a compliment, of course. Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&#39;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.</description>

      <description>On Sunday I gave my very first workshop on the Disruptor. The aim was to give people some hands-on coding experience using the syntax. Because time was limited (you can&#39;t get people to build an entire application architecture in 2.5 hours) the example is somewhat contrived, and needs a big leap to make it into a proper application context. But the workshop should:Give an overview of the DisruptorShow how to create a simple one producer, one consumer example.</description>

I haven&#39;t been great at doing that, the disconnect between the time I submit a presentation and the actual announcement means that I often forget I haven&#39;t told anyone about what I&#39;m up to.Firstly, I&#39;m back in the States this month to present my very first workshop - An Introduction to the Disruptorat Strangeloop.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming. Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) sigh.The problem with these sessions is that you&#39;re preaching to the choir. Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause. People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&#39;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.</description>

      <description>Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don&#39;t Think I Agree With.To developers technologies are everythingI can&#39;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.Is this true?It&#39;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.</description>

      <description>Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new communityof developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&#39;d never given a presentation in a pub.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;User&#39;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; presentation I gave at QCon London is now available on the InfoQ site. This is the same presentation as the one I gave at Skillsmatter in March, but the questions are different. Plus since I&#39;m winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.</description>

      <description>Three airports and three hotels in a week, and I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m coming or going. Add to that a mere four hours sleep last night, and this might resemble the ramblings of a mad woman (more than usual that is).GOTO Amsterdam was a different affair to GOTO Copenhagen, which is not necessarily a bad thing - it&#39;s great that the events have their own personalities and aren&#39;t cookie cutter versions of the same thing.</description>

      <description>So yet another interviewwith me is available, but this one is in written form. It&#39;s for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.It&#39;s long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast, again to talk about all-female events. It&#39;s only a short one and there&#39;s probably not much in there that I haven&#39;t said before, either on here or in person.From the 21st May, I&#39;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&#39;ll be talking about code &amp;amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.</description>

I was interviewed at Sunday&#39;s Girl Geek conference, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again. For those who can&#39;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&#39;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.</description>

      <description>After attending a number of conferences and events, and performing numerous interviews, I&#39;m starting to hear the same things again and again. Since Dan Northchallenged all my assumptions at QCon, I&#39;m reluctant to outright ridicule them, but I will put forward my personal opinion.Note: these are things I have heard from multiple sources, so with any luck I am not breaking the sanctity of the confessionalinterview.I&#39;ve never pair programmed, but I&#39;ve frequently worked with a partner on critical production problemsI find this fascinating.</description>

      <description>This month&#39;s Java Magazinefeatures an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor. It&#39;s basically a summary of the stuff I&#39;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to get my hair cut (yes, sorry, this is a story about hair). I had thought long and hard about what I wanted. I researched, checked styles online, and bought a magazine so I could show my hairdresser exactly what I was after and there would be no confusion. I was determined I would not be spending that ridiculous amount of money on something I was not going to be happy with.</description>

      <description>In theory, I am busy writing material for my upcoming speaking events, rather than writing terribly illuminatingposts on my blog (see what I did there?). In actuality I am being lazy and have pretty much taken January off for a recharge.In the spirit of doing something which ticks both the event-speaking and blogging boxes, this is a quick update on the conferences I&#39;m confirmed for so far. Put the following dates in your diary - these are my first international solo speaking events:7th March - QCon London - Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor(sadly I can&#39;t stay for the whole conference as it clashes with the only holiday I had booked for 2012).</description>

The third lit up when I plugged it in, and in less than a second went out. Curses. This is not what I wanted, this was supposed to be a short exercise in making my tiny little flat look festive.</description>

Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities.</description>

Makes me feel better about the presentations I&#39;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&#39;ve had a really excellent time, I&#39;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchessgirls; other Duke Award winners; the Azulguys; guys (well, girls) from O&#39;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;m off to JavaOnenext week!This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&#39;ll be there with Martin(of the Disruptorfame), and Martijn(that&#39;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&amp;hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJChe&#39;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committeerole.I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&#39;ll talk to me.</description>

      <description>As a survival trait for living and working in the cites1of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers. If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is. Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.</description>

Just because my pictures are pretty awesome doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no opportunity for continuous learning.The points Simon made in the session really made sense to me, and I wish I could have had something like that as a primer when they taught us UML at university. Without the context of what the diagrams were supposed to mean, to convey, all the boxes and lines made no sense to me back then.</description>

      <description>Martin recently announced version 2.0of the Disruptor- basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&#39;s time to mark that officially. His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&#39;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again. Now I see the disadvantage of hand-drawing everything.</description>

      <description>My recent slow-down in posting is because I&#39;ve been trying to write a post explaining memory barriersand their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martinand Mikequestions trying to clarify some point, I just don&#39;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&#39;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don&#39;t really get, I&#39;m going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.</description>

      <description>We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&#39;s even Martin&#39;s blog title. It&#39;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&#39;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.</description>

      <description>Martin Fowler has written a really good articledescribing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &amp;ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&amp;quot;.I&#39;m working up to answering that. I&#39;m currently on question number two: &amp;ldquo;Why is it so fast?&amp;quot;.These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&#39;t talk about why it&#39;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&#39;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.</description>

      <description>So now I&#39;ve covered the ring bufferitself, readingfrom it and writingto it.Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&#39;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&#39;vedone some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.</description>

      <description>The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor patterndeveloped at LMAX.After the last postwe all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&#39;re using the Disruptor.ConsumerBarriers and ConsumersI&#39;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&#39;s probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?</description>

      <description>Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&#39;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&amp;hellip; a bit wrong. We&#39;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.On the site you can download a technical articleexplaining what the Disruptor is and why it&#39;s so clever and fast.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summitto provide backup for Mike, who was on the &amp;ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&amp;rdquo; panel.The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.</description>

The resultsshow that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &amp;ldquo;landslide&amp;rdquo;.It&#39;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved. We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we&#39;re the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.</description>

      <description>Living and working in central London, you quickly learn that the fastest way around town is to cycle.My extensive research into this activity has shown there are a number of different cycling tribes. Of course, I have split them into the two groups that are most appropriate to me: 1) slower than me and 2) faster than me. You can probably tell what sort of a cyclist I am by my attitude to the two groups.</description>

      <description>I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&#39;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAXthis week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&amp;lt;gross-generalisation&amp;gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.</description>

      <description>First, an apology. I will be using the British spelling for &amp;ldquo;centre&amp;rdquo;, because, well, I&#39;m British. But it gets really confusing because you have to use the American spelling in the code. And doesn&#39;t &amp;ldquo;Centring&amp;rdquo; just look wrong?Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical CentringOne of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it. In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn&#39;t.</description>

      <description>One of the aims of this series is to highlight some stupid gotchas in support for CSS in the different browsers.Today&#39;s gotcha is table borders.Yes, yes, I said don&#39;t use tables. What I means is, don&#39;t use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data. Like, for examples, lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices.But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&amp;hellip; eccentric&amp;hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.</description>

      <description>Because I was missing coding, and because my friend and I had an awesome phone app idea at the weekend, I thought I&#39;d try my hand at developing an Android application this week.I want to give a quick overview of my preliminary thoughts on getting started on this endeavour. Background: I&#39;ve got more than 10 years Java experience, but any UI for the applications I&#39;ve worked on was always a web UI.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of my series of CSShints / tips / cheats for developers (and other technical-but-not-UI people).The screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac. The originals were on Firefox on Ubuntu so I can tell you the behaviour is identical.Part Three: Column Layout Using CSS (or: still no excuse to use tables)Today&#39;s example is a simple one, but worth knowing all the same. The aim is, once again, not to use HTML tables to provide any sort of layout.</description>

      <description>Gah!! This is exactlywhat I was talking about- it&#39;s pink, it mentions shoes, and it&#39;s about as patronising as you can get.Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Linus Torvalds? I bet for a start it wouldn&#39;t mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags. And it probably wouldn&#39;t be in baby blue either.Which leads me nicely onto the next subject I have strong opinions on: Role models.</description>

      <description>At LMAXwe adopted Google Web Toolkitpretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.</description>

      <description>(First, let me say this post contains opinion, stereotyping and sweeping generalisations. But that&#39;s sort of the point. Also I don&#39;t pretend for one moment to speak for all girl programmers, I can only speak for myself)When I first started this blog, I wanted to just post &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; technical information. I wanted to prove that there are girls out there doing &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; programming.I specifically didn&#39;t want to talk about my gender.</description>

      <description>As promised, the Long Awaited Follow-Up to CSS for Developers Part One! Well, long-awaited if you&#39;re as afflicted with NADDas I am.Quick recap - the aim of this series is to provide a quick and easy how-to around the magic that is CSS. It&#39;s primarily aimed at developers, although I would hope it&#39;s comprehensible to a range of tech-savvy people.(Note: unless otherwise stated, the screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac - given an earlier version of this guide I can tell you the behaviour is identical to Firefox on Ubuntu).</description>

      <description>I&#39;m a Java Developer. But I&#39;m also a Web Developer. Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this. There&#39;s some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren&#39;t real programmers. Similarly, &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; developers don&#39;t like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &amp;ldquo;front end stuff&amp;rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.</description>

      <description>We went live with &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; customers this week just gone. It&#39;s the culmination of nearly two years work for me personally, and three years for our company.It&#39;s really nice to be live at last, and to have our name out there. It might (in fact, should) change the focus of our work. Without paying customers it&#39;s much more difficult to prioritise work based on what they might need or want.Exciting times for LMAX!</description>

      <description>I have not (yet) seen the presentation this post is referring to. But I think many of the comments Ted makes are very valid, and our industry as a whole should occasionally stop and think. I&#39;ve seen Ted speak at QCon, and I&#39;ve had a lot of time for his comments ever since.I&#39;m aware that this blog is rapidly filling with comments about gender and perceptions and people-y stuff, when I originally wanted it to be a purely technical blog.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s celebrate our IT women&amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; knows that there are more men than women in IT. That it&#39;s a &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; job. Not a lot of people know that the first programmer was a woman. Not a lot of people realise the number of women in IT is DECREASING. And has been since the 80s. In a working world where I honestly believe that in general there are more opportunities for women (OK, inline with the other stuff I&#39;ve been reading I&#39;ll caveat this with white, middle-class women), it seems shocking that such a growth industry as IT is actually losing women, and appears unable to determine why, or stop the flow.</description>

      <description>Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.I&#39;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&#39;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m very interested in the subject of gender stereotyping, which probably isn&#39;t surprising as I&#39;m a girl in a predominantly male industry. And I like cars, and sports, and get irritated if people assume I&#39;m not &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; to be interested in these things.Far from being discriminated against, however, I find many people ask me why there aren&#39;t more women in the industry and what can be done to encourage girls into IT.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m reading Joel Spolsky&#39;s User Interface Design for Programmers. A thought that&#39;s struck me is about architecture. It&#39;s easy to get fooled into thinking building software is a bit like being the architect for a building. I&#39;m not even going to go into the differences between engineering practices à la building design and good practice software design. I&#39;m going to start from the easy point, the stuff you can see. There&#39;s often a pressure from your designers, from your steering committee, even from your CEO, to make your software look &amp;ldquo;pretty&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I think the statement that struck me the most when I was on the Certified Scrum Master course was: the start of the project is when you know the least about what you&#39;re doing.Which of course is absolutely true.So why do we come up with extensive requirements, detailed design, and fixed plans at this point of time? We haven&#39;t put anything into place yet, we haven&#39;t played with the code, the customer hasn&#39;t seen anything of what we&#39;re promising to deliver.</description>

      <description>After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented – they agreed to send me to the US.To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.</description>

      <description>Thisis a great example of what happens when you try to incentivise intelligent people on very simple metrics.They cheat.This was well described in Freakonomics, and something Mr On Softwarebangs on about regularly. It&#39;s clear that there isn&#39;t really a good answer to the problem - actually that&#39;s not true. The answer to the problem is to have everyone working in a job they are happy in and proud of, one where they are intrinsically motivated, and give them enough information to allow them to make the correct calls when it comes to prioritising work.</description>

      <description>I know there are arguments against certification, and I definitely think that using certifictionto determine whether to interview or recruit people is downright daft, because frankly learning a bunch of answers isn&#39;t all that difficult. But I personally find that completing a certification really helps to round out my knowledge in an area. I guess my thoughts are that a fairly recent certification combined with the work experience to back it up is something that would make your CV more interesting to recruiters.</description>

      <description>So if java generics slightly disappointed me lately, what have I found cool?I&#39;m currently working on a web application using Spring MVC, which probably doesn&#39;t come as a big surprise, it seems to be all the rage these days. Since this is my baby, I got to call the shots as to a lot of the framework choices. When it came to looking at implementing validation, I refused to believe I&#39;d have to go through the primitive process of looking at all the values on the request and deciding if they pass muster, with some huge ifstatement.</description>

      <description>When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought genericswere the best thing since sliced bread. No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the new for loop, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.Consider the old code:List list = new ArrayList();list.add(new Integer(1));Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0);for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {Integer number = (Integer)i.next();number.intValue();}And the new:List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; list = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();list.</description>

      <description>Isn&#39;t a shame that actual day-to-day work always seems to get in the way of progress? How you&#39;re always too busy fire-fighting to actually perform the critical thing that might actually improve affairs.All this is basically a setup for a roundabout excuse for why this blog has been neglected so shortly after it was begun. I was a bit too busy doing the day job.Still, people like Joeland Scottmanage regular pronouncements and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re much busier than I!</description>

      <description>This is a bloody good idea.
It builds upon my own Virgoen tendancies to write lists and tick things off, but what the list model lacks is the &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo; state. Plus occasionally my lists get confused.

      <description>&amp;hellip;there are a number of points in this interviewwith Paul Oldfield which are interesting to consider when thinking about &amp;ldquo;doing Agile right&amp;rdquo;. It seems to be compatible with my &amp;ldquo;people over process&amp;rdquo; view - I&#39;m not stating that having good people negates the need for any form of process or discipline, I have seen that this is simply not the case. I do however think that agile techniques in particular rely heavily upon the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; people / team, for some nebulous definition of &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Last week saw the first QCon Londonconference, an event &amp;ldquo;designed with the technical depth and enterprise focus of interest to technical team leads, architects, and project managers&amp;rdquo;.
The conference consisted of two days of tutorials followed by three days of talks covering technologies, vendor products, and processes. In addition there were numerous &amp;ldquo;networking&amp;rdquo; opportunities with plenty of break times to both absorb information and meet other people, plus evening events.</description>
