            <description>&lt;p&gt;New versions of Java are coming out every 6 months now. What has changed, should we upgrade, and if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Updated 9 July, 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wasn’t Java 8 a fantastic update to the language? Lambdas and streams were a huge change and have helped to improve Java developers’ productivity and introduce some functional ideas to the language. Then came Java 9&amp;hellip; and although the module system is really interesting for certain types of applications, the lack of exciting language features and uncertainty around how painful it might be to migrate to Java 9 left many applications taking a wait-and-see approach, happy with Java 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But now Java has a new version every six months, and suddenly Java 14 is here. We’re all still on Java 8, wondering
whether we should move to a later version, which one to choose, and how painful it might be to upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this session we’ll look at:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why upgrade from Java 8, including language features from Java 9-14&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What sorts of issues might we run into if we do choose to upgrade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the support and license changes that came in with Java 11 might impact us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few versions of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting this at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.jetbrains.com/technology-day-java-2020&#34;&gt;JetBrains Technology Day for Java&lt;/a&gt;, stay tuned for the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version from GOTO Amsterdam, June 2019 gives the &lt;strong&gt;most comprehensive coverage of the license and support changes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

This has details about the features from Java 9 that are most interesting to Java developers, and a guide on
how to migrate to Java 9. Of course, this is still valid even when migrating to Java 11, although there may be
one or two additional gotchas now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote something for Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java Magazine on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javamagazine.mozaicreader.com/JulyAug2017/Default/17/0/3704588#&amp;amp;pageSet=17&amp;amp;page=0&#34;&gt;Migrating from Java 8 to Java 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>News from IntelliJ IDEA Community</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/fosdem_2020/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Video and resources for the Update on IntelliJ IDEA talk from FOSDEM 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With releases of Java coming thick and fast every six months, it&amp;rsquo;s a full time job staying on top of the features. If
your IDE can help you here, it&amp;rsquo;s one less thing to worry about. IntelliJ IDEA Community has three releases every
year, each one improves the support for modern versions of Java, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing on offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join this session to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in IntelliJ IDEA Community (the free one!). This is not limited to just
supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things
developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well
and good, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not usable those features mean nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Procrastination</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/procrastination_2020/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/procrastination_2020/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a fantastic week of meeting with colleagues and friends, getting to know some of my organisation,
brainstorming ideas for next year, working out how to prioritise and plan, being handed greater responsibility and
freedom&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m sat in Berlin airport with loads of time until my next flight and what am I doing? Creating a brand new
coding product to play Sudoku, writing a new personal blog post and (of course) updating my personal blog platform
software (sigh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be finalising my personal and team objectives for 2020, for Q1, and for February. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be using
those to plan next month/quarter. I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be using all the notes I took this week to create sharable content for
the team and maybe even a new blog post or two for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not. I feel the urge to code, and I want to scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination? Or using the right energy for the right task when it&amp;rsquo;s there?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>2019</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/2019/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/2019/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Right so yes. 2020, hello. One of my 2020 resolutions is to get back to my personal blog. Weekly. Yeah right. Let&amp;rsquo;s
aim for weekly and be happy with monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first post let&amp;rsquo;s do the obligatory look-back-over-last-year. Not because it&amp;rsquo;s trendy (I&amp;rsquo;m 41 now, I don&amp;rsquo;t care
about
being trendy any more), but because it&amp;rsquo;s super important for me to understand what I went through and what I
achieved last year (every year), otherwise I get caught up in the hamster-wheel
of the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing. Progress should be celebrated, not just ignored for the next item on the ever
growing, ever pressing TODO list. Also, looking back helps me to plan the next year.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be super-planned, but setting some goals, objectives, ideas for which direction I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to go in helps me decide how to
prioritise that ever-growing, ever-pressing TODO list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also can I just take this moment to express how liberating it is to say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo;? My professional blog posts
contain a lot of my own &amp;ldquo;voice&amp;rdquo;, but you have to think a lot more about the reader. For the personal ones, it&amp;rsquo;s so
refreshing to be like &amp;ldquo;sure it&amp;rsquo;s nice if this helps someone or they find it useful, but ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s my thing
and it&amp;rsquo;s all about me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I procrastinating over writing about 2019? Yes for sure. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about writing this many times but not
motivated myself to do so yet. I&amp;rsquo;m sat on the plane with nothing else to do and I&amp;rsquo;m still desperately writing any
other words than the words that cover one my hardest years. Deep breath. Just do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning: in this post I talk a lot about the death of a parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 my Mum died. There, let&amp;rsquo;s just put it out there, rip the bandage off and start crying on the plane before I&amp;rsquo;ve
even
written anything of substance. That&amp;rsquo;s what 2019 will always be remembered for. I&amp;rsquo;ve
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/me_mum&#34;&gt;already written a bit about Mum&lt;/a&gt;
so I&amp;rsquo;m going to try not to go on specifically about what Mum meant to me, but obviously I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about her
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 started off rough. At the end of 2018 I was already concerned that I was burnt or burning out. I&amp;rsquo;d tried to cram
12 months-worth of work into 9 months of actual time (let&amp;rsquo;s talk another time about how maternity leave affects us
actually or in our own minds). Mum had already been diagnosed with terminal cancer but was bring treated for it.
My eldest (only 3 at the end of 2018) had just started school. Things were hard at home (I have a fantastic support
network but it&amp;rsquo;s still really difficult having two tiny children, it puts a lot of pressure on your relationship
with your other half). We had all gone to the UK for Christmas, including my Spanish mother-in-law, stayed in a
miserable hotel for two weeks so we could spend what could possibly be our last Christmas all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With home being much, much higher priority than work, plus (and I cannot stress this enough) a very supportive
boss
and employer, my focus for 2019 was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on my professional life. I said yes only to travel that was to the UK, or
to trips that I thought I was going to personally enjoy or benefit from (my trip to New York in February left me
feeling recharged even despite the food poisoning!). I went to the UK most months, alternating trips with the kids
so they could see their Gran, and trips alone so I could spend real time with my Mum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to balance doing an adequate job with my personal needs. Have you every tried to do &amp;ldquo;merely&amp;rdquo; an adequate job?
I actually found it very challenging not to push my very hardest, not to do my best, at work. To let things slip
because other things were frankly more important. I felt like I was doing a bad job at
everything all the time (of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like I could do better, and since becoming a working mother it&amp;rsquo;s
even harder to escape the feeling that you&amp;rsquo;re doing an inadequate job at everything). I turned down as many tasks,
opportunities, offers as I felt that I could. I tried to put my professional life on hold, but also keep it
ticking along, but also wind it down a bit&amp;hellip; it was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in 2019 (March I think) the doctors said they were going to stop Mum&amp;rsquo;s chemo because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working any more.
It was only a matter of time and we didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much. &amp;ldquo;Probably not years&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July I got the call from my sister I was both dreading and hoping for: &amp;ldquo;Mum&amp;rsquo;s not doing well&amp;rdquo;. Dreading, for obvious
reasons
. Hoping for, because at least there may be some warning, and I could be there. Difficult to tell if this is just
another fever that will pass, or something more. I got on a plane to pop over there for the weekend, extended my stay
when things were clearly more serious, and was &amp;ldquo;fortunate&amp;rdquo; to be able to look after Mum for the two weeks when she
most needed us all, and I most needed to be there. I missed the kids horribly but it was liberating to be there
alone and to be able to focus entirely on what Mum (and Dad) needed. My presence also meant my sister could juggle
what her kids needed as well as being available for Mum (and for me!) as much as possible.  My husband came over the
day after Mum passed away when I needed him the most. It was an awful time but strengthened the most important
bonds. I&amp;rsquo;m also extremely grateful for my Spanish family&amp;rsquo;s support looking after the kids, and I recognise my
position of privilege which made this the least bad it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August I didn&amp;rsquo;t work at all. Me, the husband, the kids, the Spanish aunts and the mother in law had all planned to be
at the beach for the month anyway, so we got away. Dad came to stay with us there for a week too, which was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September I felt compelled to &amp;ldquo;get back to normal&amp;rdquo; and to &amp;ldquo;do some actual work&amp;rdquo;. I worked my butt off from then until
the end of the year . I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I did what people at JetBrains wanted me to do, but I did what I thought were
valuable things for a Java Developer
Advocate at JetBrains to do: I presented at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/zb7Om4Cjowc&#34;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;;
I finally joined a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jcp_org/status/1172639811707920385&#34;&gt;face to face of the JCP in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;; I
presented a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lse51SpfKHo&#34;&gt;long, complex live demo at Spring One&lt;/a&gt;; I created my
first in-depth tutorial for JetBrains, something
I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do but have never had time to (not surprising! Even though I had all the material prepped for
the presentation version, turning it into a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/&#34;&gt;ten video-and-blog series&lt;/a&gt;
took literally weeks); I did all the usual
stuff (&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/pmaKRNusa7c&#34;&gt;release videos&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/&#34;&gt;annotated monthly&lt;/a&gt;,
some &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DriveToDevelop?src=hash&#34;&gt;Twitter tips&lt;/a&gt; (note: I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who contributes
to these), &lt;a href=&#34;(https://youtu.be/zb7Om4Cjowc)&#34;&gt;another conference talk&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/6sooAo4jNSA&#34;&gt;a webinar&lt;/a&gt;). I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a
day&amp;rsquo;s vacation, and I travelled much less than usual, although I did go to the UK and took the chance to have some
precious time with just my sister and Dad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took nearly three weeks off over Christmas. Dad came here for two of them, it was fantastic to connect with him
and for him to spend lots of time with his grandchildren. It was also great for him to see how we actually live
here in
Seville now, with Mum&amp;rsquo;s health he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to come for over two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 was shit for some other reasons too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We lost (Ok, &amp;ldquo;came second in&amp;rdquo;) the rugby world cup. I cried in the pub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brexit. Everything about Brexit. And the stupid election. Just&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t get me started&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My husband burst another blood vessel inside his eye and can&amp;rsquo;t see properly. Technically that was Jan 5 2020 but I&amp;rsquo;d
like to pile that up with the 2019 crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From memory, that&amp;rsquo;s my 2019. But I do want to pull out achievements/progress, good stuff, etc. These aren&amp;rsquo;t all
about me, but family life is so entangled what impacts one of you impacts you all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E (now 4) is well settled at school and has real friends. Yesterday she even said she had a boyfriend (er
&amp;hellip;). She missed her friends so much over Christmas she was desperate to get back to school. Evie is funny (&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;
funny), smart, and kind. She&amp;rsquo;s also stubborn and intelligent. Intelligence in a four-year-old is not always a good thing&amp;hellip;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A (now 2) is at that ridiculously adorable age. Old enough to be like a tiny person (also potty trained over
Christmas, yay to the end of nappies!! Just as soon as I can trust her overnight&amp;hellip;), young enough not to
require quite as much negotiation over freaking &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; as E. A likes to make you laugh, she gives the best
hugs and kisses, and she&amp;rsquo;s not stupid at all. She also is capable of the most insane meltdowns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E and A also seem to be not only getting on OK together, they seem to genuinely love each other and like playing
together. It&amp;rsquo;s adorable. And less effort for me. Marginally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My husband and I are working much better as a team than last year. This is my blog, not his, so it&amp;rsquo;s not right to
talk to much about this in public I think, but it&amp;rsquo;s important progress in 2019: we have come a long way from
arguments in the car in the alps to a couple who, in the words of my friend &amp;ldquo;actually like talking to each other&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of him, he has had some huge achievements himself. From an idea of &amp;ldquo;something cool&amp;rdquo; to a working
application that is open to friends and family, an incorporated company with other actual real people (i.e. not
just me and him) who are all super excited about the product, and investors genuinely interested in giving them
money (when they&amp;rsquo;re in the fortunate position of not needing it. Yet.). Huge professional progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For me, I made actual real friends in Seville. 2019 was the sixth year I&amp;rsquo;ve been here. Working remotely cuts you
off from people, but mostly I cut myself off. I find it hard to make friends and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to learn
enough of the language or invest enough emotional time in making friends. Evie&amp;rsquo;s school opened up options, so now
I have acquaintances I like in the other mums and dads, but also have made a very good friend of a lovely lady
. She&amp;rsquo;s welsh so I&amp;rsquo;m still too lazy to learn enough Spanish! She&amp;rsquo;s opened me up to a group of other British mums
(with Spanish partners and small children), and she and I do body pump regularly too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitness-wise, I&amp;rsquo;m not as thin as I was at the end of last year, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably because I eat better and look
after myself more. I don&amp;rsquo;t run as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to the gym at least twice a week, and
getting out for a run a few times a month. I&amp;rsquo;d like to improve this in 2020 but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have worked it into
the routine a bit in 2019.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professionally, the tail end of 2019 forced me to think a lot about what I want. And as part of that I&amp;rsquo;ve changed
my working habits to prioritise &amp;ldquo;meeting&amp;rdquo; people (via hangouts or whatever) over content. I need to change the way
I work and I recognise now that I cannot do that alone, I need to bounce ideas off people and to get outside of my
own head. Also, while my content is valuable it&amp;rsquo;s not the only value I bring as a) a developer advocate and b
) Trisha Gee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We sold &amp;ldquo;el campo&amp;rdquo;, our villa outside of Seville. It was hard to let that beautiful space go, even harder clearing
up a lot of Mum &amp;amp; Dad&amp;rsquo;s stuff that they had there before Mum even left us, knowing that however long she had left
she was never coming out to see us. But selling that place really has been one less thing to worry about, one less
bit of guilt about not using such a beautiful child-friendly space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brexit forced me to finally switch my UK driving licence for a Spanish one. Losing my residence card in San
Francisco in 2018 forced me to get a new one, which meant I applied for a &amp;ldquo;permanent&amp;rdquo; one, whatever that might mean.
We&amp;rsquo;re married, so that paperwork is done. I pay my taxes. So I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done all I can now to mitigate the Brexit
effects, whatever they might be. We still don&amp;rsquo;t know. We might never know. I just can&amp;rsquo;t worry about it any more, I&amp;rsquo;ve
done all I can, and there&amp;rsquo;s enough (literally) keeping me awake at night, I can no longer stress about something so
completely out of my control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the  shitshow that was 2019 (sorry I mean &amp;ldquo;enormous pile of &amp;lsquo;opportunities for learning and growth&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;), I have
one key objective for 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shit that was, well, shit about 2019 was almost entirely out of my control, so this might seem like a weird
objective since I don&amp;rsquo;t know what crap 2020 is going to throw at me. But anywhere I do have control, I want to use
&amp;ldquo;be happy&amp;rdquo; as my steering vision. Given a choice, which option will make me most happy? Given my ever-growing,
ever-pressing TODO list (both personal and professional), I&amp;rsquo;m going to prioritise the stuff that gives me more
joy, or
leads to more happiness. Sometimes, that will mean doing boring or crap stuff (like paperwork) in order to free me
from worrying about it. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s going to be saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to a &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; opportunity that may be fantastic,
but will mean more work, more worry, more time away from my family or simply isn&amp;rsquo;t something I want to be doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is short. Really far too short. At 41, married with two tiny kids, living like you might die tomorrow doesn&amp;rsquo;t
mean clubbing, drinking, loads of sex or whatever. It means being with my family (and actually being present with
them when I am) but also taking time for myself. Whether that&amp;rsquo;s travel for work (which can be like a mini holiday
if I get your mind and everything else in the right place) or whether that&amp;rsquo;s prioritising Body Pump over creating
some new Twitter tips. It may mean slowing down professionally, or it may mean working smarter not harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be happier in 2020. I want to be much more creative (by which I mean, feel freer with what I create, not
&amp;ldquo;create more&amp;rdquo;). I want to feel better about everything, I want to feel happy with what I&amp;rsquo;ve done, not simply look to
do more to fill the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to do this, but that&amp;rsquo;s never stopped me before. It&amp;rsquo;s just something else I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to
learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Spring Framework 5 brought full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive
programming than to actually build something live? Trisha will live code an end-to-end application using Spring
Framework 5, Spring Boot 2.2, Reactor, RSocket, Kotlin, JavaFX, and maybe even some MongoDB, all built using IntelliJ
IDEA. During this session, we’ll see how these different components can work together really easily using Spring. What
could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was also broken into a series of short (5-10 minute)
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/&#34;&gt;video tutorials with blog posts&lt;/a&gt; for the IntelliJ IDEA blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can be run as a tutorial/workshop instead of a talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would like to update this with an Angular / web front end instead of JavaFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to updating this as the technologies update&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: SC London 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/reading_code/&#34;&gt;Videos, slides and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s funny that computer languages are the only languages where one learns to write before learning to read.  It&amp;rsquo;s actually not uncommon for people to never really learn to read code.  This seems a little unbalanced given that we actually read code much more frequently than we write it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those who promote software as a craft sometimes fall into the trap of often talking about writing clean code that people can read, yet not placing much emphasis on the skill of reading the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to read code must also be a skill, and as such it must be something that can be learnt and practiced.  In this presentation, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The different reasons we might have to read code, and how that should impact our reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problems we face when reading code (even our own!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips to bear in mind when we&amp;rsquo;re reading code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools we can use to help our understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How and where to practice these skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk we will at least have considered whether we need to level up our &amp;ldquo;Reading Code&amp;rdquo; skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nameafter8alife-beyond-java-8&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;after8&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Life Beyond Java 8&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: QCon London 2019, DevoxxUK, GOTO Amsterdam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/beyond_java_8/&#34;&gt;Videos, slides and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wasn&amp;rsquo;t Java 8 a fantastic update to the language? Lambdas and streams were a huge change and have helped to improve Java developers&amp;rsquo; productivity and introduce some functional ideas to the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Java 9&amp;hellip; and although the module system is really interesting for certain types of
applications, the lack of exciting language features and uncertainty around how painful it might be to migrate to Java 9 left many applications taking a wait-and-see approach, happy with Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now Java has a new version every six months, and by now Java 14 is here. We&amp;rsquo;re all still on Java 8, wondering
whether we should move to a later version, which one to choose, and how painful it might be to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session we&amp;rsquo;ll look at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which version to upgrade to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why upgrade from Java 8, including language features from Java 9 through to 14&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sorts of issues might we run into if we do choose to upgrade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/CmPJzEqFS4s&#34;&gt;Devoxx Belgium 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Starting to code in IntelliJ IDEA is easy, but are there features you could use that
you don&amp;rsquo;t know about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ IDEA is designed to help developers to be really productive.  It aims to help you &amp;ldquo;stay in the flow&amp;rdquo;, to automatically do as much as possible while also staying out of your way.  To learn how to make the most of this, sometimes we need to see how others use the tool to understand what is possible and how it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Trisha will demonstrate how key features of IntelliJ IDEA help you to develop code more effectively.  We&amp;rsquo;ll look at some simple navigation tricks to help us to get around the IDE faster; we&amp;rsquo;ll use code generation and live templates to create code more easily; we&amp;rsquo;ll see how inspections and intentions, refactoring and code analysis can help to improve the code we&amp;rsquo;ve written; and we&amp;rsquo;ll step through some testing and debugging scenarios to understand how these tools help us to create quality code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nameteam-city-cdacontinuous-delivery-with-teamcity&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;team-city-cd&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Continuous Delivery With TeamCity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: Bitnami Sevilla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this talk, Trisha will provide an overview of JetBrains&amp;rsquo; TeamCity and how it can be used to help your team adopt continuous delivery.  TeamCity not only makes it easy to set up the build process, but also brings together relevant information to help developers to see the status of their builds, and gives us tools to locate and fix problems.  We&amp;rsquo;ll look at how to set up build pipelines, and how pipelines can speed up the build and improve feedback for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes: Was a 30 min user groups demo, could use more detail on cloud deployment and on

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: Code One 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At this conference you&amp;rsquo;ve been inspired by speakers and/or decided that you would like to be up there on stage. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve thought “I could do that!”, or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve thought “I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I could do that but I&amp;rsquo;d like to”.  What&amp;rsquo;s the next step?  How do you bootstrap a speaking career? What could you speak about? How hard is it? What do you need to know?  What&amp;rsquo;s not as important as you fear?
This session is open to everyone who&amp;rsquo;s even slightly curious about how to speak at conferences, and open to experienced speakers who would like to share their journey and their top tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namebof-diversityabof-diversity-and-inclusion---are-we-there-yet&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;bof-diversity&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BoF: Diversity and Inclusion - Are We There Yet?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presented at: Code One 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s 2018 and we still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have conferences with only one woman speaker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly see all male panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See only a small subset of races represented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use language that excludes people in job adverts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now we&amp;rsquo;ve heard that diversity makes better teams, better products, better leadership, and it seems like the industry has been beating itself up about it for some time now.  Why isn&amp;rsquo;t it fixed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is for those who feel passionately about diversity and inclusion, whether you&amp;rsquo;re from an underrepresented group or are an ally.  It&amp;rsquo;s also for those who are wondering what all the fuss is about, and those asking whether they should be making changes to their company, their events, or their own approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: A look at both modern Java syntax and Kotlin syntax to see options for making JVM code more elegant.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/boilerplate/&#34;&gt;Videos, slides and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many JVM languages promote &amp;ldquo;less boilerplate code&amp;rdquo; as one of their selling points. Even updates to Java in recent years have removed unnecessary syntax. While this is clearly meant to be a Good Thing, many of us - particularly if we&amp;rsquo;ve been writing Java for a long time - think &amp;ldquo;so what?&amp;rdquo;. Our IDEs can generate code, and our brains get used to ignoring the stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the removal of extraneous code from the syntax of a language necessary, or just a gimmick? How does it impact our ability to write and read code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Trisha will explore common coding scenarios using Java and Kotlin. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what&amp;rsquo;s important for developers to write (and, more importantly, read) and what can be removed. We&amp;rsquo;ll also see how Java has evolved to improve our productivity as producers and consumers of code, and why understanding new languages and staying up to date with the features of Java can ultimately make your life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namereal9areal-world-java-9&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;real9&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Real World Java 9&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity.  But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch the same developer itch that Java 8&amp;rsquo;s lambdas and streams did, and we&amp;rsquo;re left with a vague sensation that the next version might not be that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes to make development a bit nicer.  These features can&amp;rsquo;t be lumped under an umbrella term like Java 8&amp;rsquo;s lambdas and streams, the changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the Java Platform Module System is and how to make your code modular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The improvements to the Streams API that make it easier to control infinite streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the Collections convenience methods simplify code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way we&amp;rsquo;ll bump into other Java 9 features, including some of the additions to interfaces and Optional, and a number of other small changes that make coding in Java a bit nicer than it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re at this conference to hear all about “best practices”, the latest trends in technology, and presumably to level up your own career.  But it’s a tall order, learning to be a fully buzzword compliant developer, architect or lead, especially when What’s Hot changes on practically a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk, Trisha will give an irreverent overview of the current technical landscape and present a survival guide for those who want to stay ahead in this turbulent industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nametut-public-speakingaboftutorial-public-speaking-clinic&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;tut-public-speaking&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BoF/Tutorial: Public Speaking Clinic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have people told you that public speaking will help your career?  Are you being encouraged to present brown bags / tech sessions for colleagues?  Or maybe you need to present something to management or to the team? Or speak at a user group?
This session is aimed at inexperienced speakers - people who have never done it before, or have limited experience with presenting, who want to take that first step.
We will cover the basics - give you some simple guidelines to help prepare you for your first presentation.  The most important thing you should get out of this session is: how to deal with a sea of faces staring expectantly at you.
Come to this session if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d like to present at a user group event, but you&amp;rsquo;re not confident enough yet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re wondering if you could present at conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want practical help getting started with public speaking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your job might need you to present something, even to a small audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you&amp;rsquo;re simply curious about what it&amp;rsquo;s like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much an introductory session, although more confident speakers are welcome. We will focus on your skills as a presenter, not the mechanics of building a slide deck or talk, and we aim to guide the session according to your questions and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namerefactor8arefactoring-to-java-8&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;refactor8&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Refactoring to Java 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8/&#34;&gt;Videos, slides and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;How do we tackle all the “legacy” (pre-Java 8) code in our applications?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;rsquo;re drawing ever closer to Java 9, and even hearing about features in Java 10, it&amp;rsquo;s also true that many of us are still working with an older version. Even if your project has technically adopted Java 8, and even if you&amp;rsquo;re using it when coding new features, it&amp;rsquo;s likely the majority of your code base is still not making the most of what&amp;rsquo;s available in Java 8 - features like Lambda Expressions, the Streams API, and new Date/Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Trisha will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight some of the benefits of using Java 8 - after all, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to persuade The
Management that tampering with existing code is worthwhile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how to identify areas of code that can be updated to use Java 8 features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how to automatically refactor your code to make use of features like lambdas and streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover some of the pros and cons of using the new features, including the impact on performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this session, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better idea of when refactoring can easily be done, and when it may NOT be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Java developers who are working on an existing system. From a technical point of view, this is
suitable for junior and senior developers, but senior/lead devs and architects will find this
talk useful to decide whether to apply these changes in their applications and to provide guidance to the rest of their teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes: More live coding.  While Java 8 may no longer be “new” and “sexy”, this is yet another talk
aimed at Real Life Developers to help them with their day jobs.  Whether the application they
work on has migrated to using a Java 8 JVM or not, this talk will provide guidance on how to tackle all the existing code written before lambdas, streams, and the new date/time API were introduced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-nameangry8ajava-8-in-anger&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;angry8&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 9 is just around the corner, but many of us developers have yet to use Java 8 features in an application.  This presentation moves beyond slide-sized examples of streams and lambdas, and to shows how to build a fully working end-to-end application using minimal external dependencies and the latest version of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Trisha will build a Java 8 application live.  This application will consume a real-time feed of high velocity data, contain small services (possibly micro-sized) that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard.  Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections, and bump into the new date and time API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 9 is just around the corner, but many of us developers are still getting to grips with thinking in terms of Java 8 idioms.  This presentation shows how use lambda expressions and the streams API to to build a fully working end-to-end application using minimal external dependencies and the very latest version of Java. In fact, since we&amp;rsquo;ll be using the OpenJDK Java 9 build, we&amp;rsquo;ll even sneak in some of the lesser-known Java 9 features and see how these are going to make developers&amp;rsquo; lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Trisha will build, live on stage, an application that consumes a real-time feed of high velocity data, architected as small (possibly micro-sized) independent services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard.  Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections (from Java 8 and 9), and bump into the new date and time API.  As we design and build the application, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to slice up our application into small, independent services, and almost certainly encounter some of the common issues around running a system in this fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes: Learn how to build a realistic async application using Java 8 features, such as lambdas
and streams. For bonus points, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use JavaFX to show live streaming data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/level_up_your_automated_tests/&#34;&gt;Videos, slides and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Why one Java team started writing their tests in Groovy. And did it help?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we introduced Spock tests into the MongoDB Java driver.  The decision could be considered controversial - the project used no external dependencies in production code, and was 100% Java.  But there was a back door… with Gradle as the build system, there was a tiny excuse to use Groovy in the project, provided it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the production code. That&amp;rsquo;s all the excuse we needed to start using Spock for unit and, later, integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groovy has a lot of advantages as a testing language, and with Spock&amp;rsquo;s mocking, stubbing, and data driven testing features, it might seem as if this is the perfect way to write tests.  In this session, Trisha will cover some of the features that make Spock (and Groovy) compelling for writing tests.  But in the interests of fairness, she&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss some of the downsides, and the times when Java was chosen instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;real project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;groovy syntax is nicer for things like maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;groovy is slower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easier to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;forces people to write BDD-style tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some limitations to writing tests first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data driven testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 week spike to check it works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s a place for Java tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation will be less of a live demo than &amp;ldquo;Java 8 in Anger&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;HTML5/AngularJS/Groovy/Java/MongoDB All Together&amp;rdquo;, but there will be real code examples and demos of the sorts of tests that are possible in Spock, and which tests might be better in Java, not just slideware code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees will learn what the advantages of a Groovy framework like Spock are, and some of the costs to adopting this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namecurveakeynote-staying-ahead-of-the-curve&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;curve&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Keynote: Staying Ahead of the Curve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all want to stay ahead of the curve - after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what you go to a conference for.  But have you ever considered how being ahead of the curve might be dangerous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new language before you understand it, putting a new technology into production so you can learn it, abandoning “old practices” before you&amp;rsquo;ve got the benefit from it… These things are common practice, under the guise of Progress and Keeping Up To Date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next Shiny New Thing, we do need to see to our Continuous Learning and, of course, we should Embrace Change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see to our own growth and learning as developers and architects while meeting the needs of our project or team or organisation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namehtml5ahtml5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together---what-could-possibly-go-wrong&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;html5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;HTML5, AngularJS, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;Videos and more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to have been a common theme amongst startups to create the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) in a language that facilitates rapid prototyping (for example Ruby), and then migrate to the JVM when the application has proved itself and requires more in terms of stability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to demonstrate that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to use a static, boiler-plate-heavy language like Java to create a web application in under an hour, in front of your very eyes.  The JVM is a true polyglot platform, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to use the correct tools for each part of your application, including: AngularJS; Bootstrap; HTML 5; Web Services; Java-the-language; MongoDB; and Groovy - a fully buzz-word-compliant application.  While I won&amp;rsquo;t go into every technology in depth, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate the role of each tool and how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk we will have a fully working mobile-and-browser-friendly application, without compromising on design or good practice.  It&amp;rsquo;s even going to have tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, live coding, with all attendant danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will attendees learn?
Developers and architects who attend this talk will get a view of how to create full end-to-end applications with pretty user interfaces simply by selecting the correct tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are new to web development (or who haven&amp;rsquo;t worked on the client-side web in recent years) this will show how much easier it is to develop with HTML, JavaScript and CSS than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are used to client-side development, they&amp;rsquo;ll have a view of what happens on the server side and how the correct tools there also make it simple to create a functional back end without the learning curve traditionally associated with &amp;ldquo;back end&amp;rdquo; development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition this also shows how NoSQL technologies support rapid and agile application development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, I hope attendees learn from this that Java and the JVM is a very valid platform to choose for prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m no expert, but I have worked hard to steer my career, and I have been responsible for CV-screening and interviewing candidates for developer positions, and I&amp;rsquo;m involved with mentoring developers. Here, I like to share stories of things I learnt the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone ever give you advice on how to remain a programmer? To avoid being “promoted” into positions away from technology and code? Anyone ever tell you at school or university that you needed social skills to be a good developer? Did you know, without having had half a dozen different jobs, that all development roles are not created equal? Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing?
In this session, Trisha is going to share some lessons she learnt the hard way while managing her career as a Java developer. She&amp;rsquo;s going to tell you secrets that others don&amp;rsquo;t want to share. And she&amp;rsquo;ll give you tools for working out what your next steps are.
If nothing else, you&amp;rsquo;ll get to laugh at the (many) mistakes Trisha made in her search for The Perfect Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namecareer-archacareer-advice-for-architects&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;career-arch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Career Advice for Architects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any idea how to climb the ladder but remain technical? Or how to avoid being promoted away from what you love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you realise when you started your career just how important non-technical skills would be? What other skills would make life easier but are undervalued?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you stay ahead of the curve? Stay relevant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session Trisha is going to share some lessons she learnt the hard way while managing her career as a developer / lead / technical advocate. She&amp;rsquo;ll give you tools for working out what your next steps are. And plenty of examples of what not to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-namebest-cracode-review-best-practices&#34;&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;best-cr&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Code Review Best Practices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that Code Reviews are a Good Thing. We probably have our own personal lists of things we look for in the code we review, while also fearing what others might say about our code. How to we ensure that code reviews are actually benefiting the team, and the application? How do we decide who does the reviews? What does &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Trisha will identify some best practices to follow. She&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s really important in a code review, and set out some guidelines to follow in order to maximise the value of the code review and minimise the pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Framework 5 brings full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive
programming than to actually build something live? Trisha will live code an end-to-end application using Spring
Framework 5, Spring Boot, Reactor, Kotlin, JavaFX, and maybe even some MongoDB, all built using IntelliJ IDEA.
During this session, we’ll see how these different components can work together really easily using Spring. What
could possibly go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave this presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/6sooAo4jNSA&#34;&gt;for the vJUG (video)&lt;/a&gt;, which is a little shorter
and it does miss out the RSocket functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tutorial&#34;&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve split the demo into much smaller pieces in order to make it easier to follow along with. Each step consists of a
video of 5-10 mins and a blog post which explains the process and contains the code from the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/12/tutorial-reactive-spring-boot/&#34;&gt;All steps in the Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code may be slightly different from the demo, as the demo needs to simplify the process of creation and I get to
take my time when I&amp;rsquo;m creating the real app! This is the code for the application as I created it, before I demoed it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/s1p-stocks-ui&#34;&gt;UI (Java FX) and client code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/s1p-stocks-service&#34;&gt;Server (Kotlin) code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the exact code created for the IntelliJ IDEA tutorial, which may differ slightly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Googled a LOT for this demo, and that was even after Josh and I had already presented it at Code One in 2018!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Me Mum</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/me_mum/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/me_mum/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see what an enormous impact Mum made on my life, because she was always there. There&amp;rsquo;s a quote in the book
Good Omens: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s for the same reason you can&amp;rsquo;t see England when you&amp;rsquo;re in Trafalgar Square&amp;rdquo; - Mum was a constant,
important, dependable presence for my whole life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote something for Mum while I was on the plane from Spain to spend what was to be our last two weeks together.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of that with you all now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mum, I want to tell you some things before it&amp;rsquo;s too late.
 
I love you.  Obviously.  I&amp;rsquo;m proud of you. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of me, and you helped me to become me.  I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved so much,
professionally, physically, personally, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where I am today without you and your influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are the core of our family.  You made sure the four of us did stuff together.  Like badminton and swimming on
Saturdays, even though now I know you don&amp;rsquo;t really like Badminton and I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure you&amp;rsquo;re not that keen on
swimming either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wanted us to have adventures together.  Like that time we came out of Tesco’s in Chester and saw that we were in
the middle of a lunar eclipse, and declared &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s get out of here!”. Which I initially thought meant &amp;ldquo;the world is
ending, let&amp;rsquo;s hide!&amp;rdquo; but turned out to mean &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s get somewhere where we can have a good view and create a new
family memory!&amp;rdquo;.  I think we ended up on a hillside in Wales, which is where so many of our adventures seemed to
happen back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we weren&amp;rsquo;t driving around on adventures, you were remodelling our house. We might not have been able to go on
holiday much, but my school holiday memories were of a different type of adventure: selecting the new room to be
redesigned; creating new colour schemes; painting everything; rearranging the furniture. Thanks to this I have a
range of skills: I&amp;rsquo;m unusually good at painting gloss paint in a straight line, I&amp;rsquo;m amazing at assembling flat pack
furniture, I can lift and move furniture significantly heavier than my body weight, and I can tile and grout better
than some professionals. Thanks to you as a role model, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find out until I was an adult that our society
considers many of these to be masculine abilities. Yeah right. These skills and more have been put to good use in a
number of homes, not all of them mine! Since moving into our current house, I&amp;rsquo;ve realised though that these physical
skills are almost useless without creative energy, something you have in abundance.  I wish I&amp;rsquo;d had time to make use
of your vision in our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember that first time you went into hospital back when we were kids. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how poorly you were, I didn&amp;rsquo;t
know until much much later.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t know how your body was going to put constraints on the way you lived your
life from that moment on. But you did your best not to let it stop you. It must have been so frustrating, having
these constraints forced upon you.  We lived with it, because we didn&amp;rsquo;t really know any different, to me even the
illnesses were part of who you are, like the colour of your eyes or your laugh. But I think you resented every
limitation placed by your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not afraid. I think you thought you were controlled by fear.  But perhaps you noticed the fear of everyday
activities because you overcame the big fears so easily, at least from my point of view: moving halfway across the
country for your career and our futures; switching out of teaching to get closer to IT; taking on considerable
financial risk running a business.  Even when the business failed, you and Dad did what you always did: buckled down,
did the numbers, made a plan, and got through it. That ability to face the scary stuff, to set a new direction to
life, is hugely inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stubbornness is like your super-power. You channel stubbornness to get things done, especially things you don&amp;rsquo;t want
to do but know are important.  Like, you&amp;rsquo;d always do what had to be done before doing the things you wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your unapologetic feminism and unhappiness with the role society tried to get you to play underpins everything I do
to make my own path. For me, being a feminist, by which I mean &amp;ldquo;someone who believes women and men should not be
forced into roles just based on gender&amp;rdquo;, is normal, is natural, particularly for women. Again, something I just took
for granted because you are that way and therefore surely everyone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My determination to make my industry, even the world, a better and more welcoming place for women comes from you. It
comes from your anger that people tried to put you into a box. It comes from my anger that someone so smart, so
compassionate, so driven as you are, was disregarded because you&amp;rsquo;re a woman. You led by example in changing the
world - as a teacher, you showed kids that just because things are &amp;ldquo;always&amp;rdquo; a particular way doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it has to
stay that way. Fairness and justice were principals you taught and lived.
 
One of my favourite memories is that short period of time when I moved back from the States and I was living with
you before I found my next job and next flat in London. It was a time of talking about feminism over the morning
papers. Of getting angry about the news, about society. It was a time when I reconnected with what was important to
me, when I was really quite lost and unhappy.  It was a time of very confusing outbursts in the house (&amp;ldquo;Opium Den!&amp;rdquo;
you cried, gleefully. Mum and Dad must be doing the crossword again). It was also the time when you beat me
mercilessly at squash. How could an unfit 54 year old beat a 29 year old who was training for the New York marathon?
Repeatedly?! But that&amp;rsquo;s the great and sad thing about you - people underestimate you. Including you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also spent lots of time together when I lived above the shop, and I would spend Wednesday afternoons after I got
back from my commute between Southend and Brighton chatting with you and Tricia downstairs.  The lack of customers was
terrible for the business, but great for our time together!  And those afternoons in pubs in Southend setting the
world to rights over Bacardi and Diet Coke for you, and some terrible orange alcopop for me.  I miss those times.
They let me connect with you as a person and not just as my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t always live close by.  I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a dream of having bilingual children.  I somehow
managed this by tricking The Spaniard into dating me, moving to Spain with me, and helping me to create Evie and Amy.
Now I live in a hot, sunny country, with my husband and two little girls, I work remotely and travel the world, this is
what I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted.  But it has separated you and me physically, and that&amp;rsquo;s a hard thing to accept.  I want the
best of both worlds and I&amp;rsquo;m not used to not being able to find a way around problems. Travel for work means I can
see you more than I ever would have hoped, but it&amp;rsquo;s not enough.  I&amp;rsquo;m doubly sad that Evie and Amy don&amp;rsquo;t see you as
often as they would like.  Evie regularly asks to go to Gran and Grandad&amp;rsquo;s house &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo;, and it makes me sad that
my dream is incompatible with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t always understand that letting me be free to pursue my dreams was an act of love on your part. I recognise
now how hard it must have been to let me go, when you wanted me near and you wanted me safe. I&amp;rsquo;m forever grateful
that your love for me is one that encouraged me to find my dreams and live them, and not a love that constrains or
smothers me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mum, I love you, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss you so much.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ode to a Resting Warrior</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/ode_to_a_resting_warrior/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This July my Mum passed away, apparently cancer was the one opponent she couldn&amp;rsquo;t beat in an argument. Mum had a huge
impact on my life, as you might expect, not only personally but professionally too. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that some
more in time.  For now, I want to publish the poem my very talented cousin Izzi Giles wrote in tribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/ode_to_a_resting_warrior/therese.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Therese Gee&#34; 
alt=&#34;Photo of Therese Gee&#34; style =&#34;width: 200px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those gardens abloom,&lt;br&gt;
Entwined foliage in their sanctity,&lt;br&gt;
She stands amidst daffodils in the spring.&lt;br&gt;
That lavender arch, those plates poised on the wall, the fairy garden gnomes keeping watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In wider fields, those desolate hills,&lt;br&gt;
They seem to whisper of her spirit.&lt;br&gt;
When we look to the sunset, her smile warms us.&lt;br&gt;
When we hear the patter of rain, she gives us shelter.&lt;br&gt;
In each clap of thunder, we are reminded of her boisterous laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stands as the architect,&lt;br&gt;
Surveys the landscape awaiting fruition.&lt;br&gt;
She does not falter in her doubts about the future,&lt;br&gt;
Her descendants will continue to build until completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She resides in each empowered woman in this family,&lt;br&gt;
Her teachings of respect and strength have not been neglected.&lt;br&gt;
Her legacy remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each echoed remark,&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps a quirk that was admired,&lt;br&gt;
Each time you speak with her conversational mannerisms,&lt;br&gt;
She is listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this resting warrior, her love knew no bounds.&lt;br&gt;
In the immortal words of Christina Rossetti;&lt;br&gt;
“For if the darkness and corruption leave&lt;br&gt;
A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,&lt;br&gt;
Better by far you should forget and smile&lt;br&gt;
Than that you should remember and be sad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Reading Code Is Harder Than Writing It</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/reading_code/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/reading_code/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;We should invest more time in the skill of reading code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny that computer languages are the only languages where one learns to write before
learning to read.  It&amp;rsquo;s actually not uncommon for people to never really learn to read code.
This seems a little unbalanced given that we actually read code much more frequently than we write it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even those who promote software as a craft sometimes fall into the trap of often talking about
writing clean code that people can read, yet not placing much emphasis on the skill of reading
the code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ability to read code must also be a skill, and as such it must be something that can be
learnt and practiced.  In this presentation, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The different reasons we might have to read code, and how that should impact our reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The problems we face when reading code (even our own!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tips to bear in mind when we&amp;rsquo;re reading code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tools we can use to help our understanding&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How and where to practice these skills&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of the talk we will at least have considered whether we need to level up our &amp;ldquo;Reading
Code&amp;rdquo; skill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Code Review Best Practices</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/code_review_best_practices/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/code_review_best_practices/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fogbugz.com/blog/code-review-best-practices/&#34;&gt;guest post for FogBugz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find bugs and security issues early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the readability of our code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick guide to help you to create an effective code review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-we-do-code-reviews&#34;&gt;WHY do we do code reviews?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question to answer when reviewing your code review process is: what&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of our code reviews? When you ask this question, you soon realise that there are many reasons to perform code reviews.  You might even find that everyone in the team has a different idea of why they&amp;rsquo;re reviewing code. They might think they&amp;rsquo;re reviewing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check for potential performance or security problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ensure readable code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To verify the functionality does what was required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make sure the design is sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To share knowledge of the features that have been implemented and the updated design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To check the code meets standards&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;or one of hundreds of other reasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everyone in the team has a different &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;, they&amp;rsquo;re looking for different things in the code. This can lead to a number of anti-patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code reviews take a long time as every reviewer will find a different set of problems that need to be addressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviewers become demotivated as every review throws up different types of problems depending upon who reviews it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews can ping pong between the reviewer the code author as each new iteration exposes a different set of problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a single purpose for your code reviews ensures that everyone taking part in the review, whether they&amp;rsquo;re a code author or a reviewer, knows the reason for the review and can focus their efforts in making sure their suggestions fit that reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-we-looking-for&#34;&gt;WHAT are we looking for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when we understand &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re doing the review can we figure out the things we want to look for during the
review. As we&amp;rsquo;ve already started to see, there are a huge number of different things we could be looking for during our review,  we need to narrow down the specific things we really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we&amp;rsquo;ve decided the main purpose of our reviews is to ensure the code is readable and understandable, we&amp;rsquo;ll spend less time worrying about a design that has already been implemented, and more time focusing on whether we understand the methods and whether the functionality is in a place that makes sense. The nice side effect of this particular choice is that with more readable code it’s easier to spot bugs or incorrect logic. Simpler code is often better performance too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should always automate as much as possible, so human code reviewers should never be worrying about the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting &amp;amp; style checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If performance meets specific requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common security problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, what a human reviewer should be focusing on might be fairly simple after all - is the code &amp;ldquo;usable&amp;rdquo;? Is it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Readable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintainable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are checks that cannot be automated. And these are the features of code that matter most to developers in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are not the only people who matter though, ultimately the code has a job to do. Our business cares about: does the code do what it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do? And is there an automated test or set of tests to prove it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, does it meet so-called non-functional requirements? It is important to consider things like regulatory requirements (e.g. auditing) or user needs (like documentation) if these checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;who-is-involved-in-code-reviews&#34;&gt;WHO is involved in code reviews?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a clear purpose and a set of things to be looking for in a review, it&amp;rsquo;s much simpler to decide who should be involved in the review.  We need to decide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who reviews the code?&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to assume that it should be one or more senior or experienced developers.  But
if the focus is something like making sure the code is easy to understand, juniors might be the correct people to review - if an inexperienced developer can understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the code, it&amp;rsquo;s probably easy for everyone to understand.  If the focus of the review is sharing knowledge, then you probably want everyone to review the code.  For reviews with other purposes, you may have a pool of reviewers and a couple of them are randomly picked for each review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who signs off the review?&lt;/strong&gt; If we have more than one reviewer, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand who ultimately is
responsible for saying the review is complete. This could be a single person, a specific set of people, a quorum of reviewers, specified experts for particular areas of the code, or the review could even be stopped by a single veto. In teams with high levels of trust, the code author might be the one to decide when enough feedback is enough and the code has been updated to adequately reflect concerns that were raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who resolves differences of opinion?&lt;/strong&gt; Reviews may have more than one reviewer.  If different reviewers have
conflicting advice, how does the author resolve this? Is it down to the author to decide? Or is there a lead or expert who can arbitrate and decide the best course? It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how conflicts are resolved during a code review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when&#34;&gt;WHEN?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When&amp;rdquo; has two important components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do we review?&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional code reviews happen when all the code is complete and ready to go to production.
Often code will not be merged to trunk/master until a review is complete, for example the pull request model. This
is not the only approach. If a code review is for knowledge sharing, the review could happen after the code has been
merged (or the code could be committed straight to master). If the code review is an incremental review that is
supposed to help evolve the design of the code, reviews will be happening during implementation.  Once we know: &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;
we do reviews; &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;rsquo;re looking for; and &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; takes part, we can more easily decide when is the best time to
perform the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the review complete?&lt;/strong&gt; Not understanding when a review is complete is major factor that can lead to reviews
dragging on indefinitely. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing more de-motivating than a review that never ends, a developer feels like
they&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the same thing forever and it&amp;rsquo;s still not in production. Guidelines for deciding when the
review is complete will depend upon who is taking part in the review, and when the review is taking place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2017/03/14/code-review-for-knowledge-sharing/&#34;&gt;knowledge sharing reviews&lt;/a&gt;, it
could be signed off once everyone has had a chance to look at the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2017/01/18/code-review-as-a-gateway/&#34;&gt;gateway reviews&lt;/a&gt;, usually a single
nominated senior (the gatekeeper) says it&amp;rsquo;s complete when all their points
are addressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other types of reviews may have a set of criteria that need to be passed before the review is complete.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All comments have been addressed by fixes in the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All comments have either led to code changes, or to tickets in the issue tracker (e.g. creating tickets for new
features or design changes; adding additional information to upcoming feature tickets; or creating tech-debt tickets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments flagged as showstoppers have all been addressed in some way, comments that were observations or lessons to
learn from in the future do not need to have been “fixed”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-do-we-review&#34;&gt;WHERE do we review?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fogbugz.com/blog/how-to-build-a-code-review-culture-an-interview-with-derek-prior/&#34;&gt;Code reviews don&amp;rsquo;t have to happen inside a code review tool&lt;/a&gt;. Pair programing is a form of code review. A review
could be simply pulling aside a colleague and walking through your code with them. Reviews might be done by checking
out a branch and making comments in a document, email or a chat channel. Or code reviews might happen via
github pull request or a piece of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/upsource&#34;&gt;code review software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things to consider when doing a code review, and if we worried about all of them for every code review, it would be nearly impossible for any code to pass the review process. The best way to implement a code review process that works for us is to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; are we doing reviews? Reviewers have an easier job with a clearly defined purpose, and code authors will have
fewer nasty surprises from the review process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; are we looking for? When we have a purpose, we can create a more focused set of things to check when
reviewing code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; is involved? Who does the reviews, who is responsible for resolving conflicts of opinion, and who ultimately
decides if the code is good to go?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; do we review, and when is the review complete? Reviews could happen iteratively while working on the code,
or at the end of the process. A review could go on forever if we don&amp;rsquo;t have clear guidance on when the code is finally good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt; do we review? Code reviews don&amp;rsquo;t need a specific tool, a review could be as simple as walking a colleague
through our code at  our desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these questions are answered we should be able to create a code review process which works well for the team.  Remember, the goal of a review should be to get the code into production, not to prove how clever we are.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Speaker Tips - Focus on Either Content or Delivery</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_content_or_delivery/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_content_or_delivery/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re a new speaker, or just starting to consider speaking at conferences or user groups
for the first time, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to become overwhelmed by all the things you worry
about when delivering a talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You worry about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to talk about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What level to pitch it at&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to structure the talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to include code in the slides or in live demos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your slides (everything about slides - style, format, font, transitions, the number of them,
pictures, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_what_to_wear/&#34;&gt;What to wear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything about your voice: how fast to speak, how to pitch your voice, when to breathe, how
loud you should speak / how to project your voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s OK to drink water during the talk and when to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to stand, whether to walk or hide behind a lectern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do with your hands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;about a million other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This list is not meant to give you &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; things to worry about! It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny window onto the
things I worried about as a new speaker, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good reminder for more experienced speakers,
and for conferences, that new speakers are worried about a lot of things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I found a trick that helped me when I started out, and it might help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to conferences, or watch conference talk videos, you might notice that a bunch of talks
have either good content &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; good delivery.  There are a very small number of talks that have
great content &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; great delivery. And that&amp;rsquo;s fine! As an attendee, I can only really absorb a few
points during an hour long talk, if I was blown away with every presentation during the day of a
conference, by the end of the day I would be saturated and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most attendees go to a talk to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an overview of a topic or technology they don&amp;rsquo;t know. Afterwards they&amp;rsquo;ll either dig deeper
into it themselves, or discard it as not appropriate for their needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a bit more about a topic or tool they are already using to see if they can use it more
effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be entertained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is useful to bear in mind when you&amp;rsquo;re considering topics, prepping the talk, and practicing.
It&amp;rsquo;s also useful to remember when that sea of faces is staring at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first JavaOne, just before the first time I presented, I saw a bunch of talks that were
actually not that well presented at all (in terms of delivery), but I learnt stuff from them. I
also saw talks that were very well delivered, that were light on any real content but that I
really enjoyed.  That made me realise that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be amazing at delivering &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have
really advanced, well explained, really technical content. I could focus on either content or
delivery, and hope the audience learnt a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose, for my first solo presentation, to focus on delivery. I chose delivery because I knew I
was already OK at this, but I also knew what I had to do to be better at it. I had experience
speaking to groups of people in different contexts, and I was more comfortable thinking about
making sure I spoke slowly and clearly enough and working a bit on my stage presence, rather than
freaking out about my slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early presentations I chose to use the default simple Keynote theme, tried to have either a
single picture or a small number of words on the slides, and tried to avoid bullet points.
I forced myself not to tweak the slide deck once it was drafted, but instead to focus on my
delivery. This made me a better presenter and helped me to worry less about the talk (or more
accurately, give me a limited sub-set of things to worry about).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say in later presentations, like my live demos, I focus far less on delivery and much more on
content. I speak too fast, move too little and don&amp;rsquo;t make enough eye contact, but I do have what
I hope is content that appeals to real world developers and helps people to see how to use things
in their day job. And that&amp;rsquo;s a conscious decision too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously focusing on delivery doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can get away with having &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; content! But I have
a trick for getting enough content to practice and deliver. I sketch the content into three
sections: 1) an intro 2) the main content and 3) a summary. I then split the content into three
main points too. These are the three points I&amp;rsquo;m going to go into in depth, and I&amp;rsquo;ll also use
them in the summary too. Then I just fill in sections: three main points, an intro and a
summary. The content may evolve from there but it&amp;rsquo;s a good trick to get the meat of the talk done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a rough rule of thumb of a maximum of one slide per minute of the talk. So
50 slides for a 50 minute talk is not going to leave time for questions. Also, that&amp;rsquo;s a LOT of
slides for a 50 minute talk. It only gives you one minute to talk about each slide, so each slide
can only have one concept on.  Really you want far fewer slides than that (maybe half the number
of slides to number of minutes?). And each slide is just a reminder of the things you want to
talk about for that minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip for not stressing about the content: I know you want to make your slides pretty, and
I know the conference probably gave you a slide template to use. But don&amp;rsquo;t mess around with any
of that. Use the most simple slide template and have as few words as possible on the slides.
Don&amp;rsquo;t take millions of hours finding or creating the perfect image. Keep it simple.  Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on content, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be because you want to look really clever.
By
focusing on content, I mean having some technical content that the audience is going to learn
something from. This might be because you really know the topic well, or you&amp;rsquo;ve researched it
well, or it could be an introductory session on something the audience doesn&amp;rsquo;t already know. So, if
you know a lot about a topic you might choose to focus on how to present that content (e.g.
slides, code examples, live demos, etc), rather than worrying about delivery specifics like
whether you talk too fast or mumble a bit. The trick with talks on subjects where you know the
topic well is often how to cut it down to something that will fit into the time available. Tip:
50 minutes (a standard conference talk time) is not a lot of time. Again, you might want to look
at the &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; of figuring out three points you want the audience to get out of it and limit the
talk to that. You can always provide them with links to more in depth information or additional
resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. In summary. When you&amp;rsquo;re starting out, don&amp;rsquo;t panic about everything you could possibly worry
about. As a new speaker, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be great at everything. As an experienced speaker
I&amp;rsquo;m not great at everything either! So pick your battles. Decide whether you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus
on content or on delivery. When I say &amp;ldquo;focus&amp;rdquo;, I mean &amp;ldquo;worry&amp;rdquo;! You&amp;rsquo;re going to worry about things
as a new speaker, decide which subset of things to worry about.  If you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on
delivery don&amp;rsquo;t do anything complicated like live demos and keep your slides super simple. If
you&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on content, you should be more concerned about how to demonstrate the
things you want to talk about and don&amp;rsquo;t worry so much about the technicalities of presenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you become more experienced, obviously you can change your focus and improve in whichever
areas you feel need attention, but when you&amp;rsquo;re starting I find it helps to focus on either good
delivery of a presentation or good content for a talk. Limit the things you&amp;rsquo;re going to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Speaker Tips - What to Wear</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_what_to_wear/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_what_to_wear/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cover it because I
didn&amp;rsquo;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want other
women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&amp;rsquo;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking
long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&amp;rsquo;s not how everyone works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, as someone who&amp;rsquo;s been working at home for five years; as someone who&amp;rsquo;s been presenting at big conferences for seven years; as someone who has to hustle to get out of the house in the mornings in order to get the kids to school; I now feel like having to spend lots of time deciding what to wear is just an enormous cognitive load. And, incidentally, one that most men don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this intro is to say: I am (or have been) the sort of person who cares a lot about how I look. But I can also
inhabit the other end of that spectrum and feel there are things that are significantly more important to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all of that, there are some factors that you really do have to consider in terms of the practicalities of what
you&amp;rsquo;re wearing when you present at conferences, and I want to cover some of these.  As usual, my advice is from my
point of view as a woman, but it may also be helpful to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_mic_fitting/&#34;&gt;already written a long piece on the impact of wearing a mic&lt;/a&gt; and mention in there some
of the limitations it puts on what you wear or how you style yourself. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll look at some other
considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearing a dress is tricky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my piece about &lt;a href=&#34;(/post/st_mic_fitting/)&#34;&gt;wearing a mic&lt;/a&gt;, a dress is not always a practical choice
for presenting
in as there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to put the mic pack. I personally find this sad, as I like a classic dress to present in. But
dresses also don&amp;rsquo;t always pack well - I have several great ones that are stretchy and don&amp;rsquo;t crease, but many
dresses don&amp;rsquo;t cope well with being squished into hand luggage. I also worry (&lt;em&gt;Trish neurosis alert&lt;/em&gt;) that dresses are
more identifiable and I would hate to be seen presenting in the same thing twice (sigh. Fortunately I don&amp;rsquo;t apply
this to corporate t-shirts or simple tops, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d be buying a LOT of new clothes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skirt length is tricky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Concurrent-Programming-Using-The-Disruptor&#34;&gt;first solo presentation&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;oh
bless look, I&amp;rsquo;m so nervous!&lt;/em&gt;) I was
wearing a brand new dress I&amp;rsquo;d bought just for presenting at that conference. I had
not worn it &amp;ldquo;in real life&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;d only tried it on.  Turned out, just through the everyday process of getting to the
venue by Underground that this dress was MUCH shorter than I realised. I tried to mitigate it on my way to the venue
by buying opaque tights to wear with it, but I was very self concious (and this is despite the fact that I was
notorious for wearing very short skirts to work all the time). It was a particularly bad choice because this talk
involved me pointing to lots of things on the screen and waving my arms a lot, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to raise my arms
for fear of making my dress ride up even higher than it already was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk got rave reviews, but I have not worn that dress in any professional capacity since. And when I wear it at
home, I wear it with shorts or leggings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story is not only to be aware that skirt length may be impact by arm waving (and don&amp;rsquo;t forget
you&amp;rsquo;re probably also on a raised stage with people looking up at you&amp;hellip;.), but also that you need to wear something
you have worn In Real Life at least once, recently, to understand how it feels and how it fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just mentioned that you might be on an actual stage. I own a LOT of high heeled shoes, and I consider (or at
least, considered) myself a pro in walking in ridiculous heels. But even I think twice about walking up the stairs
to a stage wearing 6 inch heels, there will be a lot of people to laugh at&amp;hellip; I mean, with&amp;hellip; me if I fall over on my
way to start my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like to wear heels / awesome shoes though. For practicality reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve simply settled
on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Px2Hv2zWCM0?t=245&#34;&gt;jeans and t-shirt&lt;/a&gt;
(usually a JetBrains one) to present in (it works for the mic, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to pack, it&amp;rsquo;s minimal cognitive load
thinking about it, I wear the jeans all the time so I know how they look and how they fit). The only real scope for
individuality is to wear fantastic shoes. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m a short-ish woman (5 ft 4), if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be on stage with
men, I like to measure up comparably to them. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a silly thing to worry about, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thoughtco.com/does-the-tallest-presidential-candidate-win-3367512&#34;&gt;studies do show people
prefer tall men&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m going to use
every trick I have to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m seen as a person with authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did say this was from a woman&amp;rsquo;s point of view.  I know you all know that it&amp;rsquo;s important to have a bra that fits
properly. I also know that you all know
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/youve-probably-been-wearing-the-wrong-bra-size-for_us_59494134e4b09edb4c91f2ba&#34;&gt;most of us are not wearing the correct size bra&lt;/a&gt;. Something I noticed when I
watched back one of my talks is that I repeatedly had to re-adjust my bra strap because it was falling down.  This
was super distracting. So that bra is out of rotation for presenting (the straps don&amp;rsquo;t actually go any tighter,
which is irritating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably dozens of other concerns around bras, not just about getting the size right so it&amp;rsquo;s comfortable
and sits correctly. I worry about my bra being visible (either the straps being visible, the top of the cups being
visible, or the pattern or shape showing through my top). I also worry that a camera flash might show up something
that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t see under normal light. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much advice here, I&amp;rsquo;m just passing on some of the things I
worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More tricks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly these days as I said I want to reduce cognitive load around this area. I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to think about it.&lt;br&gt;
Because the conferences I present at also require travel to get there, usually plane travel, I have some other
things that make my life easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packing lists. I have a list of stuff to pack when I&amp;rsquo;m going to a conference (separated into suitcase list and
laptop bag list). These lists are extensive and have things I don&amp;rsquo;t need to take every time, so I make a copy of
the master list for each trip, delete the stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t need (like: sandals and sunscreen if it&amp;rsquo;s winter), and then
I can pack just the stuff I need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a full makeup kit and toiletries for travelling. I don&amp;rsquo;t pack a selection of my home make up &amp;amp; toiltries,
I always just take my travel kit. The toileties are obviously travel size and in that silly transparent bag you
need to get it through airport security. I also have a comb, razor, etc, duplicates of all the stuff I have at home
but just packed up and ready to go. The exception here is I don&amp;rsquo;t have a duplicate electric toothbrush, I have to remember mine, but I do have a &amp;ldquo;manual&amp;rdquo; toothbrush in my make up bag just in case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a pack of &amp;ldquo;conference electronics&amp;rdquo; - my display port adaptors (to three different types of display, but
now everyone just uses HDMI) and my remote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have UK, European and US power supplies for my laptop. Not only does this mean I have good redundancy, but it also
means I don&amp;rsquo;t need to mess around with adaptors which are always the wrong shape and size to fit into whichever
power socket you have available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess those last two don&amp;rsquo;t fall into what to wear. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always try on your conference outfit in advance. And not just at home in front of the mirror, actually wear it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider that being on a raised stage may pose limitations, e.g. on skirt length or heel height for getting onto
the stage (related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/182087729&#34;&gt;I once presented on a raised stage without steps&lt;/a&gt;. It was tricky
for me to get onto with heels and a skirt, but impossible for my pregnant co-presenter to get on to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try and minimise things that will irritate or distract you. For me, this is things like my bra strap constantly falling down, or my hair getting in my face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a set &amp;ldquo;uniform&amp;rdquo; for presenting in, packing lists, travel packs specifically for conferences will all help
you to think less about all of this and more about something more interesting. Finding a uniform is going to be
about finding your style, and that&amp;rsquo;s a bigger question outside of the scope of this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all, wear something that makes you feel confident, and comfortable enough.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Speaker Tips - Wearing a Roaming Mic is More Complicated Than I Realised</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_mic_fitting/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/st_mic_fitting/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I realise I have a bunch of experience and advice for speakers and potential speakers that I
simply haven&amp;rsquo;t written down or shared. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first piece on things to consider that you
might not have thought about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: as usual, my advice is from the point of view of a woman (me) and is aimed mostly at
women, but also as usual it&amp;rsquo;s probably useful for others to know too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to make you aware of the process of having your mic fitted when you&amp;rsquo;re speaking at
a conference.  This is something that I no longer give much thought to because it&amp;rsquo;s just
routine, but in retrospect there&amp;rsquo;s a lot about this one simple process that needs to be shared
with speakers and prospective speakers, firstly to set expectations appropriately and secondly
because mic fitting has a surprisingly big impact on your choice of clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why I started thinking about this.  First, last year
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sc-london.com/&#34;&gt;SC London&lt;/a&gt; had a woman fit me with a mic for my talk. At that moment I
realised I had never been fitted by a woman before, and that actually that was quite shocking.
Particularly as I realised that this woman was here specifically just to fit the mics onto women
speakers (the technician was a man, as usual) and I really appreciated this touch from the
conference organisers to consider the needs of the women speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when I saw
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.them.us/story/skyler-jay-reveals-his-true-feelings-on-queer-eyes-trans-makeover-episode&#34;&gt;the episode of Queer Eye&lt;/a&gt; where Skyler
Jay was explaining how uncomfortable he was being fitted for a suit because another man would be
up close and touching his body, it occurred to me this could apply to mic fitting for speakers too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me explain the process, and perhaps give some tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most conferences, particularly if you want to move around the stage, will fit you with a roaming
mic of some sort (i.e. you will not be using a stationary mic at a lectern or similar). Usually
this mic is made up of the microphone itself (either a lapel mic or a headset with a mic on), a
long-ish wire between the mic and the battery pack, and the battery pack / transmitter. The mic
needs to be placed on you somewhere near your mouth, the battery pack needs to be put on you
somewhere comfortable and inconspicuous, and the wire needs to run between the two as invisibly
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technician will fit your mic. As I just mentioned, this is almost always a man. Most will ask
permission before trying to place any of the equipment on your clothing or person.  Some will
ask you to do it yourself.  Note that I said &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; will ask permission before touching you or
your clothes.  Some do not. I personally never saw it as a problem because a) I expect the
mic-fitting process and probably have simply offered my body to be fitted and b) I have always
felt like the technician saw me as just another piece of equipment to set up and adjusted before
the presentation. I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt like the technician took an unhealthy interest in being that
close to a person&amp;rsquo;s body, if anything they&amp;rsquo;re uncomfortable doing this with a woman.
But I realise that for some people this process could be more intimate than they might like,
particularly as attaching something to your waistband actually requires the person attaching it
to have fingers rather closer to one&amp;rsquo;s underwear than one would normally allow (note: most
technicians prefer to put the mic in a pocket than mess around with your waistband).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice would be: take ownership of this process if you feel at all uncomfortable (or worry
that you might become uncomfortable). When the technician introduces themselves (and they always
do) you can state up front that you want to fit everything yourself, or ask what needs to be
fitted and where, and be clear about what you are or are not comfortable with the technician
doing. I&amp;rsquo;ve given dozens of talks, maybe as many as one hundred, and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a time
when an approach like that would have been rejected by the professionals involved.  Also, I
expect many conference organisers would be very accommodating if you asked them in advance what
their arrangements were for microphone and mic fitting to prepare them and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to go into the microphone set up / fitting in a bit more detail because I&amp;rsquo;ve found
that having to wear a roaming mic actually impacts quite a lot of what you might choose to wear
and how you might choose to style your hair.  I realise how &amp;ldquo;girly&amp;rdquo; that sounds but that&amp;rsquo;s just
the reality of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/st_mic_fitting/lapel-mic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lapel microphone attached to neck&#34; title=&#34;Lapel microphone attached to neck&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example lapel microphone, clipped on to the neck of the top, from [ProgNet London Keynote](https://youtu
.be/XFkAi0P2hVA). Note the wire goes from the mic down inside the t-shirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the setup: Often the wire between mic and pack needs to go inside your t-shirt / top so
it can&amp;rsquo;t be seen. Technicians will ask you to do this yourself and tell you the easiest way to
do it (note: while I&amp;rsquo;ve found that I can usually just pull my t-shirt away from my skin and drop
the wire down, sometimes there&amp;rsquo;re some adjustments which mean some skin might be on display -
remember this is usually on stage, some time before the talk, and the audience might be there.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found longer, looser tops are the best for concealing everything. I expect you could
probably ask to do this in a private space, or alternatively just wear a visible wire outside
your clothes). For &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Vy8EzOjnseE&#34;&gt;a recent keynote&lt;/a&gt;, my male colleagues and I were wearing
jackets/blazers, so
they just hid the wire under the jacket. I don&amp;rsquo;t like wearing a layer on top of my t-shirt when I
present, as I can find it hot, uncomfortable and restricting. But it is a good way to hide
things, including sweat patches!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/st_mic_fitting/headset-mic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Headset Microphone&#34; title=&#34;Headset Microphone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example headset microphone, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/GkP83hvdeMk&#34;&gt;from DevoxxUK 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Note also I am wearing a dress. I probably hid the pack on the back of the neck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the mic is a headset, you will have some sort of headpiece on your, er, head.  It&amp;rsquo;s usually a
thin flexible wire that runs along the back of your head from ear to ear.  If you have long
hair, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to lift your hair for the technician to fit it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got your hair in
some sort of updo, this might interfere with the way the mic sits. I&amp;rsquo;ve presented with
ponytails, French plaits, and braids and buns, I generally haven&amp;rsquo;t discovered much of a problem
in terms of how the mic sits or how comfortable it is, but often removing it will pull a bunch
of hair out of whatever updo you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/st_mic_fitting/headset-mic-updo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Headset Microphone with Updo&#34; title=&#34;Headset Microphone with Updo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Headset mic can be worn with a complicated updo, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/SbZscPDs4U0&#34;&gt;Devoxx Belgium Closing Keynote, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lapel mics pose other issues. As mentioned, usually a wire needs to run from your neck to your
waist, usually inside your top. The lapel mic needs to be fitted to, erm, your lapel. This
usually means attaching it to the neck of your t-shirt like in the first picture above, but if you&amp;rsquo;re wearing a v-neck
or more
unconventional neckline, it can sometimes be hard to get the mic in the right place.  If it&amp;rsquo;s
positioned too far to one side (left or right) you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with the sound getting too loud or
too quiet as you move you head.  In my experience technicians can usually find a way to make it
work, but it is something to be aware of when selecting which top you&amp;rsquo;re going to wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/st_mic_fitting/lapel-mic2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lapel microphone attached to t-shirt&#34; title=&#34;Lapel microphone attached to t-shirt&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lapel microphone clipped to the t-shirt material (note how the top now bunches up), the neckline was too high to attach the mic to the neck, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/XFkAi0P2hVA&#34;&gt;ProgNet London Keynote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of tops&amp;hellip; I have found it easier to wear a top and skirt or top and trousers/jeans,
because as I mentioned above, you generally need a waistband to clip the microphone pack to or
have pockets to put it into. If you wear a dress, there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to attach it to. I have
presented with the pack clipped to the neck of the dress at the back, which isn&amp;rsquo;t super
practical, or with the pack dangling at my back attached to my neck by a lanyard. It was only
slightly choking me&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some roaming mics are not very roamy.  They&amp;rsquo;re actually cabled with a great big long cable which
follows you around. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been forced to use this set up a couple of times but it does
happen.  Needless to say, not only do you feel somewhat tethered to the stage, it also poses a massive trip hazard, one that&amp;rsquo;s particularly worrying if you&amp;rsquo;re wearing heels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last word on mics.  I gave up on dangly earrings years ago because I just could not be bothered to change my earrings every day. However my sister bought me awesome dinosaur earrings for Christmas and I just had to wear them for the presentation I just gave yesterday.  As soon as the technician came to fit my mic, he asked me to take them off, because they were going to clang against the mic headset and make a bit fat clattering noise every time I moved my head.  So sadly I had to remove them and wear my classic BCRs.  This is not a problem with lapel mics, but be aware that if you have a headset mic you may need to remove your earrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When speaking at a conference you may be fitted with a roaming mic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are usually fitted by male technicians, and may involve running a wire down the inside of your t-shirt, and
usually requires you to clip a pack onto your waistband or put it into a pocket&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lapel mics need to be attached somewhere, usually the neck of your top or t-shirt. Low cut or v neck tops may be
more difficult to attach to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headset mics may be more difficult to wear with certain hairstyles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may be asked to remove dangly earrings to avoid unwanted noises into the mic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should be able to set your own boundaries to suit your comfort level. And, of course, you can always opt to
use a stationary  / lectern mic which avoids a lot of these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this was helpful. I would also love others to share their mic tips in the comments&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken at JavaOne (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016) and have received the JavaOne Rock Star
award several times. I&amp;rsquo;ve presented many times at QCon London, and other notable conferences
include QCon New York, Devoxx BE and UK, JavaZone, CraftConf
OSCON and various GOTO conferences. I also regularly present to user groups around the world, and
am a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Diversity and Inclusion: Are We There Yet?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/diversity_and_inclusion/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/diversity_and_inclusion/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s 2018, and we still&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have conferences with only one woman speaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regularly see all-male panels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;See only a small subset of ethnicities represented&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use language that excludes people from job advertisements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By now we’ve heard that diversity makes for better teams, better products, and better leadership, and it seems like the industry has been beating itself up about it for some time now. Why isn’t it fixed? What can we do? This session is for those who feel passionate about diversity and inclusion, whether you’re someone from an underrepresented group or an ally. It’s also for those wondering what all the fuss is about and those asking whether they should be making changes to their company, their events, or their own approaches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of some of the interesting articles I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently about diversity in the
workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The way you recruit people matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers documented an unwelcoming environment for these women, including sexist jokes
and imagery, geeky references, a competitive environment, and an absence of women engineers—all of which intimidated or alienated female recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/why-are-there-few-women-in-tech-watch-a-recruiting-session/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/why-are-there-few-women-in-tech-watch-a-recruiting-session/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity in Computer Science Graduates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The juggernauts of the first computing revolution like HP and IBM actually had reasonable gender
diversity, and IBM had its first female VP back in 1943. But fast forward to 2014 and just 31 percent of Facebook’s employees are women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;while the nation has, overall, increased the number of CS course offerings in K-12 education,
black and Hispanic students are less likely to have access to those resources. They’re also at a disadvantage outside of the classroom: Two-thirds of white students report using computers at home, whereas only half of black and Hispanic students do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women were majoring in computer science because it was something they were expected to be good
at.” Since then, the number of women studying CS has been falling pretty steadily since the 80s, despite the increase in demand for these types of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study from Georgetown University found that more women are studying STEM majors, they’re just
not choosing computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/computer-science-graduates-diversity/&lt;/a&gt;
(contains charts)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How being in the minority affects you at work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our interviews, we recognized four strategies that women reported using to deal with this
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2018/10/the-problem-of-visibility-for-women-in-engineering-and-how-they-manage-it?autocomplete=true&#34;&gt;https://hbr.org/2018/10/the-problem-of-visibility-for-women-in-engineering-and-how-they-manage-it?autocomplete=true&lt;/a&gt;
Good overview of how women have to downplay being women (or up-play tech skills)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gendered conditioning tends to encourage men to be stoic and independent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a direct example of how working with people you can relate to can positively influence your
career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship is very important. The black community where I work we have a hard time finding that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2018/03/how-black-women-describe-navigating-race-and-gender-in-the-workplace&#34;&gt;https://hbr.org/2018/03/how-black-women-describe-navigating-race-and-gender-in-the-workplace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating people fairly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;women must outperform men to be evaluated similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because investment professionals with names more likely to be considered female do not differ in
terms of performance and other observable characteristics, our analysis provides strong evidence that evaluators are incorporating gender into their assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a silver lining: In our sample, women were not penalized at the second stage
of the evaluation process. We found no gender difference in the ratings or number of comments recommendations received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with previous research that has shown people exhibit greater reliance
on status signals, such as gender, when there is greater uncertainty about quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that when women — and probably other underrepresented groups, too — are being
evaluated, such as for a job, they may benefit from presenting more information about their experience and performance, to minimize ambiguity about their quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, our research suggests that while policy interventions, such as providing
opportunities for women and minorities in investment management, help redress skewed distributions of the workforce, women still may face unfair assessments once in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, our results suggest that search costs in evaluations (having many options to
consider) intensifies gender bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2017/10/research-objective-performance-metrics-are-not-enough-to-overcome-gender-bias&#34;&gt;https://hbr.org/2017/10/research-objective-performance-metrics-are-not-enough-to-overcome-gender-bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Technology Gender Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By analyzing its massive database, Entelo created a fresh and detailed picture of the current
status of women in tech. Report findings include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall only 18 percent of roles in tech, including engineering, data science, product design
and more, are held by women in the U.S., and the ratio falls even more sharply when considering seniority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more senior the position, the lower the proportion of women. While at entry level and
mid-level, women account for 19 percent of tech roles. At the senior level, the percentage drops to 16 percent, and at the executive level, only 10 percent of roles in tech are held by women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of women in tech also varies by function. When looking at engineering, data
science, and product design roles specifically, Entelo found that engineering had the lowest percentage of women (17 percent) while product design has the highest (36 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additionally, by region, gender diversity in tech is nearly identical from the west coast to
the midwest to the east coast. On the west coast, women accounted for 18 percent while the midwest saw 17 percent. On the east coast, 19 percent of tech roles were filled by women. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/08/1418510/0/en/Quantifying-the-Gender-Gap-in-Technology-Entelo-Reveals-Analysis-of-450-Million-Candidates.html&#34;&gt;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/08/1418510/0/en/Quantifying-the-Gender-Gap-in-Technology-Entelo-Reveals-Analysis-of-450-Million-Candidates.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nice charts showing the gender and ethnicity information for a number of key technology firms
&lt;a href=&#34;https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/&#34;&gt;https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the data showed a 50% drop in representation from women when comparing entry-level to
executive roles within the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/03/23/technology-gender-gap-report-finds-10-tech-executives-female/&#34;&gt;https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/03/23/technology-gender-gap-report-finds-10-tech-executives-female/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discovered a near-universal playbook to the bias women face at work, which falls into four main categories: the Prove-It-Again bias; the Tightrope bias of being too masculine or too feminine; the Tug of War; and the Maternal Wall. Of the four, the Maternal Wall bias was the most blatant, in part because many people don&amp;rsquo;t see it as a bias; they see it as biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key finding was that the female-founded companies in its portfolio performed 63 per cent
better than those founded by men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has backed up the obvious: a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that
over 30-year careers, mothers were far more productive than women without children at nearly every point in their careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers with one child performed similarly to childless men, but men with multiple kids were
more productive than the rest of the men studied (although the increase in productivity was nowhere near as dramatic as it was with women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sarah-lacy-gender-bias-silicon-valley&#34;&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sarah-lacy-gender-bias-silicon-valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay inequality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stunning but perhaps unsurprising finding was that 63% of the time, men were offered
higher salaries than women for the same role at the same company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in tech also tended to undervalue their market worth, asking for less pay 66% of the time,
 and would often ask for 6% less salary than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding suggests that if a company wants to attract key talent, taking steps to eliminate
pay gaps within their company would be a clear recruitment tool for all genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gender wage gap also increases with age. When women start in their careers, between the ages
20-25, they make $0.97 for every dollar men in similar roles earn. The gap widens by the time workers are in their forties, increasing to $0.90 on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White women earn 96 cents on the dollar compared to White men. White women also outpace the
earning of Black and Hispanic men, who earn 94 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She noted that the report found that identifying as LGBTQ+ negatively affects salaries for men,
but women who identify as LGBTQ+ actually make more money than other females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to effectively combatting bias and closing earning gaps, study after study shows
that transparency wins the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyatarr/2018/04/04/by-the-numbers-what-pay-inequality-looks-like-for-women-in-tech/#1dfb645160b1&#34;&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyatarr/2018/04/04/by-the-numbers-what-pay-inequality-looks-like-for-women-in-tech/#1dfb645160b1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women, however, outnumber men in lower-tier jobs, such as secretarial and administrative roles,
whereas men predominate in senior positions. And women cluster in occupations and industries that pay lower salaries overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/10/20/why-do-women-still-earn-a-lot-less-than-men&#34;&gt;https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/10/20/why-do-women-still-earn-a-lot-less-than-men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISS data found that companies have not promoted women at the same rate into leadership board
positions, even though they come in with greater qualifications than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/why-2018-could-be-a-record-year-for-women-joining-corporate-boards.html&#34;&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/22/why-2018-could-be-a-record-year-for-women-joining-corporate-boards.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time out of the workforce for caregiving may compound the impact of earlier leave taken to
care for a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.caregiver.org/women-and-caregiving-facts-and-figures&#34;&gt;https://www.caregiver.org/women-and-caregiving-facts-and-figures&lt;/a&gt;
Lots of scary and interesting stuff in there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second shift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So women work a longer second shift than men, a difference of 1.1 hours daily, though men work
longer hours on the first shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, at least one recent survey found that 97% of professionals had some flexibility in
their jobs. Men are more likely to work remotely than women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/3055391/revisiting-the-second-shift-27-years-later&#34;&gt;https://www.fastcompany.com/3055391/revisiting-the-second-shift-27-years-later&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was not until the late 2000s that a group of young women earned more than the median young
man—but only women who were unmarried, childless, living in a city, and 22-30 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When some work is underpaid or not paid at all, other workers (or nonworkers) in the economy are
correspondingly overpaid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefeministwire.com/2012/04/gender-equity-still-requires-a-focus-on-the-second-shift/&#34;&gt;https://thefeministwire.com/2012/04/gender-equity-still-requires-a-focus-on-the-second-shift/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, researchers at Cambridge University looked into the average working week. For women in
full time employment they worked an average of 68 hours (including commuting, domestic work and child care). The average working week for a man was 55 hours (including commuting and domestic work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reality was so different. If she was to grow a successful business then she decided to
employ a nanny. She lived with the guilt of this decision for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.handbagsintheboardroom.com/double-burden-second-shift-holds-women-back/&#34;&gt;http://www.handbagsintheboardroom.com/double-burden-second-shift-holds-women-back/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And the wider the class gap, and the more people fall into the lower class, the more bad news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/08/06/the-second-shift-at-25-q-a-with-arlie-hochschild/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.f76efeeb0def&#34;&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/08/06/the-second-shift-at-25-q-a-with-arlie-hochschild/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.f76efeeb0def&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Code Review Best Practices</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/code_review_best_practice/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/code_review_best_practice/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;(Updated 23 July, 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know that Code Reviews are a Good Thing. We probably have our own personal lists of things we
look for in the code we review, while also fearing what others might say about our code. How to
we ensure that code reviews are actually benefiting the team, and the application? How do we
decide who does the reviews? What does &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this talk, Trisha will identify some best practices to follow. She&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s
really important in a code review, and set out some guidelines to follow in order to maximise the

            <title>Career Advice for Programmers</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/career_advice_for_programmers/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;One developer&amp;rsquo;s journey to find the perfect job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you know how to remain a programmer? To avoid being “promoted” into
positions away from technology and code? Did they teach you at university
that you need social skills to be a good developer? What other skills do you
need that aren&amp;rsquo;t technical? Did you know that all development roles are not
created equal? Is it true that moving jobs a lot is a Bad Thing? In this
session, Trisha Gee (Java Champion, 2015 MongoDB Master, 2016 / 2014 / 2012
JavaOne Rock Star &amp;amp; Technical Advocate for JetBrains) will share some lessons
she learnt the hard way over nearly twenty years of managing her career as a Java developer. She&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s really important to developers when thinking about their careers, and give you tools for working out what your next steps are. If nothing else, you’ll get to laugh at the (many) mistakes she&amp;rsquo;s made in her search for The Perfect Job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

realise that we have no idea how to figure out if someone is actually good at programming&lt;/li&gt;

insight into how some people do technical recruitment&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to
present at a lot of conferences.  &lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt; all these conferences are mostly interested in my
terribly educational talks, but it&amp;rsquo;s also because I&amp;rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&amp;rsquo;t very
many technical women speaking at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do at this point have to roll my eyes somewhat though.  It&amp;rsquo;s an additional bit of workload that
my male peers do not have to do: they are not asked to recommend suitable women speakers; they
are not asked what a conference should be doing to improve diversity.  And let&amp;rsquo;s not forget that
one of the reasons why I have made it to this point in our male industry is by having some
combination of luck, selective blindness and an unusual attitude which means that I&amp;rsquo;m probably not
qualified to speak on behalf of all the other women developers/speakers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. To save myself some time in the future, here&amp;rsquo;s my blog post version of
stuff-that-I-can-think-of-that-might-help. This is not scientific. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch more stuff out
there on the internet (including
&lt;a href=&#34;https://continuousdelivery.com/2013/09/how-we-got-40-female-speakers-at-flowcon/&#34;&gt;one from Jez Humble&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/help-someone-has-pointed-out-my-conference-has-diversity-issues-c1162a1e8d4c&#34;&gt;help, my conference has diversity issues&lt;/a&gt;),
please do Google for more.  The following suggestions come from my experience as a) a speaker b)
a programme committee member of QCon London, DevoxxUK and DevoxxUS and c) just a normal person
who thinks about these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-a-code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;Have a Code of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many many things have been written about this, I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to rehash them. You need one, if
you don&amp;rsquo;t have one go and research this and put one in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consider-diversity-as-a-key-cross-cutting-concern-of-your-conference&#34;&gt;Consider Diversity as a Key, Cross-Cutting Concern of Your Conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a
conference without researching venues; without figuring out the catering; without doing analysis
of costs. If you&amp;rsquo;re serious about diversity, about improving the industry, or even just about not
being attacked on Twitter, you have to consider diversity right from the start, and you have to
consider it in the context of almost every other decision: Does the venue have step-free access?
Can the caterers provide a range of non-alcoholic drinks rather than just the standard beers? Do
the dates clash with some major religious festival? Or football event? (for example).
Considering people with different needs, cultures, interests is something that you need to take
seriously at every step. Diversity is not something you can just tack on at the last minute.
This Is Hard.  It helps if your organisers/program committee members are diverse, as others will
think of things you have not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-website-and-marketing-material-should-represent-the-people-you-want-to-attract&#34;&gt;Your Website and Marketing Material Should Represent the People You Want to Attract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make
sure that on your website and in your emails/tweets, photos of attendees and speakers
represent the range of people you want to come. Don&amp;rsquo;t just put up a handful of photos
from last year&amp;rsquo;s conference without looking very closely at who is, and who is not, shown in
these photos.  From a gender diversity point of view, my rule of thumb is that every photo should
have at least one female-looking person visible in it, ideally closer to 50%. Other measures of
diversity that may be visible in photos include race and age, but
it can also be things like dress code - the first DevoxxUK attracted people with pink mohawks,
goths, men/women in suits, as well as the usual tshirt-and-jeans brigade.  It was wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To showcase diversity in photos/images, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show your organisers/programme committee. In my experience there are usually women in amongst
the organisers, having photos of them on the site in a visible place is a good way to suggest to
women that if they submit a talk they will be evaluated by people like them. As usual, I&amp;rsquo;m
focusing on gender, but this can apply to other dimensions too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select photos from previous conferences that include women (I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that the new
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation&#34;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; may prevent you from
posting photos of people publicly without their consent, so be careful here). Make sure they&amp;rsquo;re
not booth babes (Note: Do Not Allow Booth Babes. By all means, women should work on
sponsor booths, but they should be employees of the company, not women hired in to look a
particular way to sell the product). Ideally in these photos the women should look like they are
being included, e.g. in groups talking to people, not standing alone to one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showcase your diverse speakers.  This is a catch 22 of course, because you want to showcase
diversity in order to attract speakers to submit, so you can&amp;rsquo;t show diverse speakers before
you&amp;rsquo;ve had speakers submit&amp;hellip; You can show speakers from previous years; you can show your
keynote speakers (hint: it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to have at least one woman giving a keynote and you
should secure them well before the CFP closes so you can show them off); you can invite selected
speakers early who won&amp;rsquo;t go through the CFP and show them on the site (see next
section)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just about photos, it&amp;rsquo;s also logos/imagery and language.  If you have characters, make
sure they&amp;rsquo;re not all men/masculine. If you have a theme, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s open to all.  I really
loved
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devoxx-uk-2015-stephan-janssen/&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&amp;rsquo;s League of Extraordinary Developers&lt;/a&gt;,
it showed a range of diverse characters, not
just gender and race but implied we&amp;rsquo;re not all the same and we have different strengths and
skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also check the language you use. There have been a number of studies
that show that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2016/12/14/how-to-take-gender-bias-out-of-your-job-ads/#490276c71024&#34;&gt;language in job adverts can subtly imply male vs female
roles&lt;/a&gt;. But even easier
than that, make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t assume attendees will be a &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t use words like &amp;ldquo;guys&amp;rdquo; -
you may have seen this used in a gender neutral way but many people feel it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; gender
neutral and implies &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;invite-women-speakers-early-and-personally&#34;&gt;Invite Women Speakers Early, and Personally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women speakers are very much in demand.  There
are more conferences than women speakers, and we get booked up well in advance (my next 9-12
months are usually already booked up).  If you want to
ensure you have a decent proportion of women speakers, you need to reach out to us personally,
early, and ideally offer us a guaranteed speaking slot. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of being asked to submit
to a CFP, I get invited to enough conferences that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to go to more, and going through a
CFP adds a lot of variability. For experienced speakers who you know you&amp;rsquo;re likely
to accept anyway, consider offering them a guaranteed slot.  For less experienced / new speakers,
invite them to submit.  But whoever you&amp;rsquo;re reaching out to, at least (please) put their name on the
email.  One of the conferences suffering from a lack of women speakers at the moment invited me
with a standard email addressed to &amp;ldquo;Dear madam&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m usually strict about replying to requests
but I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to reply to this one as they didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to customise their
request to me.  On this topic, what I want to see in an invitation email (and maybe other people
are different) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the first paragraph: which conference (with link); date; city; very very short description
of the conference (&amp;ldquo;community run Java conference&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Europe&amp;rsquo;s biggest devops conference&amp;rdquo;,
something that gives me a rough idea of technology and community); what do you want me to
speak about (either a specific talk, or a more general topic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cover travel/accommodation, put that somewhere near the beginning of your email, this
can make it much easier for a speaker to say &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other useful information can go in the later paragraphs: approx number of attendees; who else
is presenting / has presented in the past; interesting activities during the conference / in
the city.  None of this stuff is mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bit of flattery / how you know about me is always welcome. Oh but don&amp;rsquo;t be creepy &lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-women&#34;&gt;Find Women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy, right? Not so much.  But please, don&amp;rsquo;t just email the first woman speaker
who comes to your mind and say &amp;ldquo;please come and speak, and also if you could find us all the other
women speakers we need that would be great too&amp;rdquo;. By all means ask for recommendations (from all
speakers actually, it&amp;rsquo;s freaking exhausting being a woman speaker because we do a lot of work in
this area, connecting people up and pointing them in the right direction and plenty of
experienced male speakers are better at this than me). But this is a numbers game - there aren&amp;rsquo;t
many women speakers and those that do this regularly are very in demand, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to
invite a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of women to stand a chance of having a diverse line up. Here are some suggestions
based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past to find women speakers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google &amp;ldquo;Women in&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Java, Data, Blockchain, whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at big conferences in this space from the last two years, spot the female-ish faces and
make a list of them. When asked for Java/JVM recommendations, I check JavaOne,
DevoxxUK/Belgium, JavaZone, JFokus and maybe Google &amp;ldquo;Java conferences&amp;rdquo; to find the others I&amp;rsquo;ve
forgotten. For broader topics I look at QCon London because I know they always
work hard on diversity and have had a bunch of really fantastic women speakers in the past. I
sometimes check out the GOTO conferences for the same reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for local user groups who could help.  You can search Meetup.com
for &amp;ldquo;Women code&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Lady developers&amp;rdquo; and variations on that theme.  Find the groups in the area
local to the conference, and reach out really nicely to them to ask if they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind
circulating the details of your CFP amongst their members.  Remember to provide them with
information about why their members want to speak
(all travel covered/opportunities to meet various people/mentoring provided, whatever). If you
can see previous speakers at these groups, you could add them to your list of women to reach
out to personally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/callbackwomen&#34;&gt;Callback women&lt;/a&gt; to retweet the CFP details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the networks of women speakers, like
&lt;a href=&#34;http://articulate-network.lanyrd.com/&#34;&gt;Articulate Network&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fempire/women-tech-speakers-organizers&#34;&gt;this list of women speakers&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://womenwhokeynote.com/&#34;&gt;Women who keynote&lt;/a&gt;.  Google
for these lists too, there&amp;rsquo;s loads of them. Sadly these resources are not very centralised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provide-travel-and-accommodation&#34;&gt;Provide Travel and Accommodation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to attract/grow new
speakers. You may not have budget to apply this to everyone, but if you really want to have diverse
speakers you may need to set aside some budget to pay for them.  In my first year of presenting I
was doing it more or less on my own (vacation) time because I had a real job as a real
developer, and I could only speak at conferences who would cover my costs.  This is even more
tricky for self employed people as they&amp;rsquo;re also losing money by attending your conference.  Be
aware that not everyone a) is a professional advocate (and even when we are it&amp;rsquo;s easier to say
yes to a conference if our employer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay) b) is employed by a forward-thinking
employer who is happy to let employees go to conferences or c) has paid vacation time they are
willing/able to use. Be aware that for some people this cost might be more than just
the cheapest flight and cheapest hotel for one person - one conference paid for me,
my partner and my (at the time) one-year-old to travel halfway around the world so I could speak at
the conference. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take that time away from my family so they brought the whole family,
I would not have been able to speak there otherwise.  Another conference this year is paying
for all four of us to travel, plus a family hotel room - I&amp;rsquo;m currently breastfeeding and I can&amp;rsquo;t
leave the baby for very long, and if I&amp;rsquo;m going to bring the baby I need to bring the husband to
take the baby while I&amp;rsquo;m talking, which means we also need to bring the toddler, because she&amp;rsquo;s
a bit young to leave at home alone for a weekend.  I don&amp;rsquo;t always need all these costs covering,
I&amp;rsquo;m not always breastfeeding, and even after the first was born there were plenty of times I could
travel alone.  But if you want to improve your diversity you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to consider these
sorts of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provide-rehearsal-space&#34;&gt;Provide rehearsal space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite time consuming and relies on having people willing
to watch the rehearsal and give feedback.  I actually mean &lt;em&gt;virtual&lt;/em&gt; space here, I&amp;rsquo;ve given my talk
via hangouts to the track lead for QCon New York to get feedback on a new talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re trying
to attract new talent, consider involving one or more local user groups and running a speaker
training session. The London Java Community has done this a couple of times. You need to select
the people who will provide mentoring / feedback &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; carefully.  They need to be aware of the
type of gendered words that are frequently used for women and avoid them (would
you ever use the word &amp;ldquo;feisty&amp;rdquo; for a man? No, you would not); they
need to be aware that women get
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2017/04/how-gender-bias-corrupts-performance-reviews-and-what-to-do-about-it&#34;&gt;critical personality feedback&lt;/a&gt;
instead of actionable feedback.
The feedback to help mentor new speakers, particularly women speakers, needs to be well thought
out (not &amp;ldquo;you seem nervous&amp;rdquo;, maybe &amp;ldquo;is there some section of the content
that makes you uncomfortable&amp;rdquo;, for example). These mentors need to be experienced speakers.
Ideally they should also be diverse, but if this is not possible then men who are experienced at
championing women will be OK (my mentors were all men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also run community nights, these
aren&amp;rsquo;t sessions aimed at training the speakers, but user group events where you can have
prospective speakers present their talk. Obviously this works if a) the speaker is local and b)
you have links with appropriate local user groups.  But this is a good way to grow the community,
and to try out speakers without having to judge them through a CFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-lightning-talks-on-the-agenda&#34;&gt;Have lightning talks on the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning talks can be a very mixed bag of quality and can introduce complexity to your scheduling.
But they&amp;rsquo;re also a good way to get inexperienced speakers
into the conference, and to give them an opportunity to be videoed (and have conference speaking
on their CV) so they can break into speaking properly.  As an attendee I like lightning talks -
the topics are often varied, and ones I often wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother watching a whole hour of, and I&amp;rsquo;ll
tolerate poor content/poor delivery for 10 minutes without complaint.  You will need to consider
your cost/benefit here though, I doubt you&amp;rsquo;ll want to pay expenses to ship a whole family of four
over to your conference for the sake of a 10 minute talk, these seem to work best in encouraging
local developers to speak at your conference.  Again, ties with local user groups will be key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-open-to-flexible-scheduling&#34;&gt;Be Open to Flexible Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I really do, that your conference is really hard to
schedule. Not just the
actual dates, but who presents in which room at what time.  This is super difficult, and most
speakers understand this and will accept the vague &amp;ldquo;your talk will be one of these three days&amp;rdquo;
notice. Many speakers who are just starting will probably love to be there for the whole
conference, I certainly did! But this is really hard for people who can&amp;rsquo;t get the time off work
or away from their family. It&amp;rsquo;s also less exciting when you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen many of the talks
you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started doing this, my work was peeved if I took three days off to travel to a
conference.  Now, I&amp;rsquo;m peeved if I take three days away from my family.  There&amp;rsquo;s a really hard
balance for us speakers to strike, especially when
we book our own travel: we either need to book early to get cheap travel, in which case we
don&amp;rsquo;t know when our talk is so we have to be there for the whole conference; or we book as soon
as we know the date and time of the talk, in which case someone is going to be stung with higher
travel costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering diversity also means understanding that not everyone lives in or near a city
with a major airport. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get spoilt in London, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, because
there are so many flights to so many places from there.  But because I&amp;rsquo;m
travelling from somewhere that isn&amp;rsquo;t a major airport,
direct flights to many conference locations are rare, and if they exist are almost always only
on a couple
of days the week and at horrible times, so my ability to get to and from the conference is
limited. This either adds one or two days either side of the conference waiting for the
right flight (so days and days away from the family for a one hour talk), or means I have a very
small window during your conference that I can be there. What would make my life easier is one of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me my time slot as soon as possible.  Oh, and do tell me.  Most conferences don&amp;rsquo;t
bother, I have to check the schedule when it&amp;rsquo;s posted on the website which is often only a
couple of weeks before the conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow me to suggest the best dates/times for me. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to accommodate
everyone, but for those of us with difficult schedules and/or who want to limit time away from
home/work, I would really like to be able to say &amp;ldquo;I can only do this conference if I can talk
Monday afternoon&amp;rdquo; and not sound like a diva.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consider-diversity-scholarships&#34;&gt;Consider Diversity Scholarships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conferences offer discounts/free tickets for underrepresented groups.
I feel a bit torn on this topic personally because I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of positive discrimination and
this looks a bit like that.  But if you have offered something like this, it may attract
speakers from underrepresented groups as well, because you are doing something proactive. If you
consider this idea please do your research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swag-isnt-just-for-boys&#34;&gt;Swag isn&amp;rsquo;t Just for Boys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started going to conferences I got really annoyed
that all the free t-shirts were &amp;ldquo;unisex&amp;rdquo;, i.e. male.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about this any more
because I&amp;rsquo;d like to wear clothes that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually chosen and paid for that actually fit me.
But it does annoy a lot of women
speakers and attendees, and it&amp;rsquo;s always noticeable when a conference goes out of
its way to have women&amp;rsquo;s shapes and sizes. But don&amp;rsquo;t make them a different colour/logo, this just
says &amp;ldquo;hey women, you&amp;rsquo;re like a totally different species and we&amp;rsquo;re going to make you stand out&amp;rdquo;.
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that in 100% of the cases where I&amp;rsquo;ve had a different colour the men have been
totally jealous of my much more attractive women&amp;rsquo;s cut top, what matters is you don&amp;rsquo;t want to
make the minorities stand out even more than they already do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just t-shirts either. For each bit of swag, think &amp;ldquo;would I give this to my sister / gay
friend / muslim co-worker?&amp;rdquo;. Not everyone at the conference is a beer-drinking, youngish,
straight, white, single male. And even those who are can be offended by swag that stereotypes
what they should be interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;consider-having-a-blind-cfp&#34;&gt;Consider having a blind CFP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past that I&amp;rsquo;m really not sure about this
as a solution, but other sectors and other conferences have had success with this.  Perhaps if
you combine this with actively reaching out to women and giving them guaranteed speaking slots,
maybe this will address the weaknesses of both the invitation and the CFP processes. Do your
research, see how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;note-for-women-speakers&#34;&gt;Note for women speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that advice for conference organisers, I&amp;rsquo;d really like to say something to the women
speakers out there. As usual, my advice applies to men too, but I want to talk specifically to the
ladies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a conference invites you to speak and you have no intention of going, please respond with a
&amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; as promptly as possible.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been on both sides of the
invitation (inviting speakers to speak and being invited) and as an inviter it is very very
frustrating not to hear anything back from a valued speaker, especially if there&amp;rsquo;s a slot held
for this speaker that needs to be filled. As a speaker, every time I&amp;rsquo;ve said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;
within a few hours of getting the email, I almost always get a very nice response
saying &amp;ldquo;thanks for the quick reply&amp;rdquo;.  Saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; quickly is not ever going to be considered
rude, it&amp;rsquo;s actually very helpful to the organisers.  Waiting a while because you want to phrase
it in a nice way, or
simply never getting around to responding because you mean to think the offer through and/or
spend some time on the reply (and I am &lt;em&gt;the worst&lt;/em&gt; at this in most of my email) puts the
conference into limbo - yes, they will have invited plenty
of other speakers so they&amp;rsquo;re not just dependent upon you, but if half of them don&amp;rsquo;t take the
time to respond the organisers don&amp;rsquo;t know if they need to reach out to more people or not. And
as a speaker it&amp;rsquo;s a bit embarrassing to respond a week or more later with a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; only to have the
conference say &amp;ldquo;er, sorry, we didn&amp;rsquo;t hear from you so we&amp;rsquo;re all full now&amp;rdquo;. This has happened to
me. I felt bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know you&amp;rsquo;re not going, say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; straight away (&amp;ldquo;thanks for the invite, really pleased
you&amp;rsquo;re interested in having me, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I can&amp;rsquo;t make it&amp;rdquo;, or something, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be
long winded and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to justify why you&amp;rsquo;re not going).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about it
but you have to work out details/check with work/run it past your partner/research costs,
respond telling them you&amp;rsquo;re thinking about it, and give a rough date of when you&amp;rsquo;ll get back to
them (&amp;ldquo;thanks for the invite, it looks really interesting, I can&amp;rsquo;t commit right now because
I&amp;rsquo;ve got some stuff to work out, if I don&amp;rsquo;t get back to you by the end of next week please give
me a nudge&amp;rdquo;). If you&amp;rsquo;re having some trouble working out the details (maybe the flights are too
expensive, maybe work won&amp;rsquo;t give you the time off) update the conference with this information
because they might be able to do something (give you money towards travel; send you some useful
blurb to wave at your boss about why this is a good business investment for them, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously if it&amp;rsquo;s a yes just respond straight away with yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t, please, just fail to respond.  I know you&amp;rsquo;re super busy, I know you have an inbox stacked
full of more important things you haven&amp;rsquo;t got around to.  Set up a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en&#34;&gt;Google template&lt;/a&gt; (or equivalent) and it
will take seconds to reply, and it&amp;rsquo;s one more mail you can get out of your inbox.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot
of frustration from conference organisers that the women they contact never reply, and because human
nature is the way it is, it leaves organisers feeling demotivated and makes them less likely to
reach out to other women.  I know this isn&amp;rsquo;t your fault, but it is something we can all help to
improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-summary&#34;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably loads and loads of things I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned.  And it&amp;rsquo;s possible that
conference organisers could do all of these things and still not reach the numbers they want. But I
can practically guarantee that if, as an organiser, you don&amp;rsquo;t do any of these, you aren&amp;rsquo;t going
to get many women speakers at all. Please, read all of these items again, and for your next
conference create a tick-list of all the
things you&amp;rsquo;re going to do, and all the things you need to check at each stage (like the imagery
and language of your marketing material).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Being a Developer Advocate at JetBrains</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_job/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_job/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandatory initial exclamation about how little I have blogged here lately.  Over a year without
updates, oh dear!  But a) I have been blogging quite a lot for the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/author/trishagee/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/author/trishagee/&#34;&gt;Upsource&lt;/a&gt; blogs, and b) I had another
baby, which kept me quite busy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&amp;rsquo;s involved in the
job, what&amp;rsquo;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&amp;rsquo;s it like
working remotely etc etc.  Given I also rather generously&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; recently offered to answer
people&amp;rsquo;s questions about my job, I thought the most scalable way was to write-once-read-many,
i.e. write it in a single blog post for everyone to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Also, if you&amp;#39;re vaguely contemplating a move into an advocacy-type role and interested to find out what&amp;#39;s involved (and/or if it will suit you) feel free to Tweet/DM/e-mail me with questions and I&amp;#39;ll do my best to brain-dump my experience onto you&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Trisha Gee (@trisha_gee) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/979014330631979010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Very Long Post.  It&amp;rsquo;s also a bit of a brain dump and is not well organised, sorry.  I
take comfort in the fact that if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the role you won&amp;rsquo;t read it, and if you do
care you&amp;rsquo;re probably interested in all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get is &amp;ldquo;How does one become a Developer Advocate?&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve already
written about &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/becoming_an_evangelist&#34;&gt;My Path to Evangelism&lt;/a&gt;, which covers how I got into
this job.  My route is not the only route, but at the bottom of that post there are some things you
can do to a) see if you like doing this kind of thing b) improve your skills in this area and c) get the
experience and visibility you need to make it easier for someone to hire you to do this
professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishagee/&#34;&gt;Developer Advocate for JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;. Developer
Advocates/Evangelists come in various different shapes and sizes depending upon the individual
and the organisation.  At JetBrains advocates do advocacy first and foremost (see the next
section which explains a bit about what I mean).  For me, this means I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physically go to &lt;em&gt;conferences&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;give presentations&lt;/em&gt;.  I prefer live coding demos, because I
think a) it makes me look clever and b) it showcases the tools nicely. This is not a requirement
of the role, it&amp;rsquo;s something I personally chose because I thought it was good for my personal
&amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo; (this is linked a bit to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m a female developer, more on that later).
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hhariri&#34;&gt;Hadi&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; talks are more varied than mine, he has plenty that aren&amp;rsquo;t
specifically code-related.&lt;br&gt;
From JetBrains point of view, if you&amp;rsquo;re out at conferences giving popular talks, that makes
the company look good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am physically in a country/city I may also seek out &lt;em&gt;user groups&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt; to go
and see. This is not a requirement of the job, but it&amp;rsquo;s something I want to do more of and get
better at.  It&amp;rsquo;s very effective and fairly limited extra overhead to also give the same talk you&amp;rsquo;re
giving at some conference to the local user group and some customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Customer meetings&lt;/em&gt;. When I originally took this role,
I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be doing a bit of consulting as part of the job, e.g. going to a customer and
trouble-shooting their TeamCity installation or running tailored training courses on IntelliJ
IDEA.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been here three years and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done that.  I have, however, done pre-sales
trips to demo a particular product (usually &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/&#34;&gt;Upsource&lt;/a&gt; and answer questions about it: what does
it do, how does it scale, where will it fit into this company&amp;rsquo;s process, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve only
physically had to travel for these a couple of times, usually a company is more than happy to
have me present this via a private webinar.  These webinars can sometimes be to a huge number of
developers (hundreds), more usually to 10-20 techies, occasionally just to one or two people.
Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a webinar or a physical meeting, I always, always have backup to help me with
things I don&amp;rsquo;t know.  I&amp;rsquo;m a technical advocate, I understand how to use the tool really well. I
don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily know everything on the roadmap (that&amp;rsquo;s usually the PMM), nor do I know all
the technical limitations (a lead techy will know this). It scares me a bit going into these
meetings knowing that I don&amp;rsquo;t know everything, but sometimes I have someone with me (either
physically at the meeting or online with me during the webinar) and I always have someone
available via Slack to answer any questions I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe my
credibility has suffered when I&amp;rsquo;ve said &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to that, let me quickly find
out&amp;rdquo;, especially when there&amp;rsquo;s almost always a fast response. If there&amp;rsquo;s no adequate response
there and then, I make a note of the question and promise to get back to them. I usually end
the meeting by repeating the next steps and listing the information I believe I have to find
out for them, and always follow up with an email. If the answers were quick to find, all the
answers will be in the follow up email. If the answers are still pending, I will tell them
that in the quick response and get back to them later with the answers (e.g. I don&amp;rsquo;t leave
them hanging with no response, it looks bad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webinars&lt;/em&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of giving webinars, it&amp;rsquo;s like doing a conference presentation, only
with
waaaaay more real-time viewers and almost zero real-time feedback. It&amp;rsquo;s like talking into the
void.  Some people like giving webinars precisely because they CAN&amp;rsquo;T see the audience.  I used
to hate them because the lack of feedback is very unnerving, but with practice (like anything)
I&amp;rsquo;ve become more comfortable with them.  I probably give maybe 3 public webinars a year (like my
upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/03/live-webinar-java-10-and-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;webinar on Java 10&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe 6 or so private ones a year.  These numbers may be
totally incorrect, but that&amp;rsquo;s what it feels like.  The public webinars are frequently one of my
conference talks just presented online, the private ones are less formal/practiced and may be
something like a short-ish live demo (10-20 mins) followed by questions and further
customer-driven demos (i.e. &amp;ldquo;can you show me how you&amp;hellip;?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screencasts&lt;/em&gt;. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done any screencasts before I came to JetBrains and they&amp;rsquo;re a totally
different skillset.  Not only do you have to learn how to use a brand new tool (I use Camtasia)
that requires a set of skills you probably don&amp;rsquo;t have already (i.e. video editing), but putting
together a 5 minute video of features is a VERY different thing to taking 40-60 minutes exploring
a concept in real-time with an audience. You have to work out up-front what it is you&amp;rsquo;re trying
to demo, figure out a sensible real-world use case for it, and then record the video and
narration that effectively shows this to users. I record those two things separately and edit
them together, others like to record the whole lot together. Because this area in particular is
one where probably most of the team was new to the skills needed, we&amp;rsquo;ve shared our knowledge a
few times here to try and improve ourselves and to try to get some consistency in approach. I
quite like doing screencasts because they&amp;rsquo;re a good way to poke at particular features in a tool,
and I like finding the use case that makes the feature make sense. But they can be quite a lot
of work. A screencast like my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/szlAxgchyXU&#34;&gt;VCS features in IntelliJ IDEA 2018.1&lt;/a&gt; can take less than a day
to
put together (most of which is editing), because this is an area of the tool I know well, and I
have a lot of example projects that showcase different use cases of Git workflows.  A
screencast on Spring features is more likely to take 2 or more days, most of which is locating
the right sort of code example that shows the features. It&amp;rsquo;s an area of the tool I haven&amp;rsquo;t used
much in a real development environment, a framework I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with but again don&amp;rsquo;t use
much, and also a framework that moves very rapidly, so I spend a lot of time getting up to
speed on the new parts of the framework and finding examples.  Screencasts generally fall into
two categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s New in {Product} {Version} (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZy-hmwOdEXtJTNC65GCuw8f7sR13UK9&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZy-hmwOdEXdOtXdFzyx_XCnrF_oD2Ft&#34;&gt;general tutorials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blogging&lt;/em&gt;. I love writing. It&amp;rsquo;s what got me into this. It&amp;rsquo;s why this blog post is SO much
longer than it really ought to be. I probably average 1-2 blog posts a month.  Probably not that
much actually, it depends a lot on my travel and other workloads. For JetBrains I blog about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New releases/features for IntelliJ IDEA and Upsource (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/12/intellij-idea-2017-3-debugger-improvements/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 2017.3: Debugger
Improvements&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topics related to the tool but aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily features of the tool (e.g.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/code-smells/&#34;&gt;Code Smells&lt;/a&gt; for
IntelliJ IDEA, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/tag/code-review-workflows/&#34;&gt;Code Review Processes&lt;/a&gt; for Upsource)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specific topic that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to readers of the blog that either is relevant at a
particular time (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/09/java-9-and-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;Java 9 and IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;), or is something I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered myself
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/10/creating-multi-release-jar-files-in-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;Creating Multi-Release JAR Files in IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;) or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/&#34;&gt;Annotated monthly&lt;/a&gt;: takes me a day every
month to put together the newsletter, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it as it forces me to stay up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or sometimes something that I think is interesting or cool and is vaguely
development-/Java-related.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;. I have access to Tweet on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intellijidea&#34;&gt;intellijidea&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/upsource_jb&#34;&gt;upsource_jb&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one behind
those handles though. I post links to the videos, blog posts and other content I produce, and I
also create content for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DriveToDevelop?src=hash&#34;&gt;Twitter Tips&lt;/a&gt;
for both of those products. I use Camtasia to record
short videos and convert them to GIFs.  The most painful part of this process is thinking of
something interesting to Tweet about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also &lt;em&gt;Tweet from my own personal account&lt;/em&gt;. As I have gained more followers I have been more
and more careful/restrained about what I Tweet from there. I recently realised these days I
retweet a lot and occasionally tweet things I think are interesting to developers. I spend less
and less time ranting on there or making personal observations, although I would quite like to
bring back a more personal element to my Tweets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theoretically I also &lt;em&gt;answer questions via
Twitter/&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/users/653519/trisha&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;/other social media&lt;/em&gt; about
our
tools.  I don&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing this very often, I should work it into my schedule/routine,
but sometimes I find it takes a disproportionally long time to replicate a problem and work out a
fix, by which time someone else has already answered or the original user has worked it out. If
someone addresses me directly I always try to respond, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just to ask someone to file
a ticket in YouTrack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Admin&lt;/em&gt;.  I actually have to do quite a lot of mundane admin stuff.  Part of it might be because
of my particular perfectionism, part of it might be because my situation really does require it.
For example, I have to book my own travel for a lot of the conferences, usually this means
flights and accommodation. I tried a travel agent for this, but I found a lot of the
complications were not around the actual booking process, but coordinating with everyone (my
family included) which times/days work best, am I bringing the family, am I going to do customer
visits, which customers might want to see me, when works for them etc. Also since I&amp;rsquo;m
travelling from Seville, we do have an airport but I&amp;rsquo;m very limited for flight choices, which
always bites me even though it&amp;rsquo;s five years since I was spoiled by living in London.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are the advocates organised at JetBrains?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at MongoDB, the Advocates were engineers who spent most of
their time working on language drivers for the database and some of their time blogging and
speaking at conferences.  At JetBrains, the Advocate position is a full time job doing the
advocacy stuff. We don&amp;rsquo;t report to engineering, we don&amp;rsquo;t report to marketing, our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadi-hariri-b0368a83/&#34;&gt;Boss Person&lt;/a&gt; reports directly to the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advocates all belong to the same team, but each advocate has their own product(s) and
specialties.  In terms of co-ordinating what we&amp;rsquo;re actually going to work on, we talk to the PMMs
(Product Marketing Managers) for our product and they&amp;rsquo;ll let us know what they need from us.
Each PMM and each product is different, so they have different interests/focuses/plans.  With
IntelliJ IDEA I spend quite a lot of time working with the PMM on each of the 3 releases a year,
and most of the rest of the content is driven by me: it&amp;rsquo;s either connected to something else I&amp;rsquo;m
working on (like one of my conference talks) or a Java release or something. Working in this
way is quite familiar if you&amp;rsquo;ve been a consultant: in this model, the PMM is basically my
customer and not my manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physically, our team is almost entirely remote. The JetBrains development teams are based in
Munich and St Petersburg, and there&amp;rsquo;s an office in Prague, so those of us on a
European timezone have an easier time of it. Our American team members tend to be dragged out of
bed earlier than they would probably like in order to dial in to meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I still code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. I don&amp;rsquo;t write enterprise code any more, and I don&amp;rsquo;t write code that goes into the
IntelliJ IDEA codebase.  I do, however, spend a good chunk of the year creating projects that
demonstrate particular things, and live-coding within these projects.  I also occasionally still
contribute to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt;, although mostly I use that as an
example code base to demo various things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love the Morphia code because it&amp;rsquo;s real lived-in code that is very similar to the sort of
code that real developers will be working with, it&amp;rsquo;s not just a nice clean toy project that bears
zero resemblance to real life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a weekly basis I don&amp;rsquo;t spend a lot of time coding, but every now and then I will devote a day
or two (or sometimes a week or two) to playing with something to scratch that itch.  This is
often used in blog posts or demos but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s enough just to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other members of my team spend more time coding, either on open source projects, on bots for
Slack, on creating tutorial code, on plugins for IntelliJ platform IDEs, etc. I probably code
less than any of the others and I would like to change that this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did I need to learn on the job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been doing advocacy before I got to JetBrains, but there were still plenty of things I
needed to learn or level-up when I got here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screencasts: I had zero experience here, and I struggled to begin with. But then the whole
team had a number of discussions about how we did them. At first I was scared to talk about
didn&amp;rsquo;t know or what I was struggling with, but I found that when I opened up (both on Slack and
during one of our annual actual-face-to-face get togethers) about my pain points, I found a)
lots of the others struggle too and b) some people had answers that worked for me.  Also c)
turned out I knew things other people didn&amp;rsquo;t know, and that gave me a big confidence boost. A
lot of this is now documented on Confluence, so new people won&amp;rsquo;t have to struggle as much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webinars: I&amp;rsquo;d done two at MongoDB and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like them.  For the first year at
JetBrains I still didn&amp;rsquo;t really like them, but we gather feedback from attendees and on the
whole people liked my webinars, and those that didn&amp;rsquo;t usually gave constructive feedback, so I
gained confidence and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve improved in this area too.  Also, it became clear I
absolutely had to pay a lot more for my home internet connection, since the major complaint was
always that my sound would frequently cut out or get out of sync. Now I have faster internet and
it&amp;rsquo;s made my (work) life all round much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self management: I&amp;rsquo;ve worked a lot at &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; enterprises, where there&amp;rsquo;s a clear chain of
command.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked for consultancies, where customers have clear expectations of you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at startups, at one of which my manager liked to micromanage everyone, down to the
lines of code they wrote. JetBrains is not like any of those.  It is genuinely a flat
organisation (as I mentioned above, there&amp;rsquo;s very little management between me and the head boss
person), and people are given the freedom to work on what they want to, more or less however
they want to, you&amp;rsquo;re trusted to get on with your job.  This can be quite a change if you&amp;rsquo;re used
to formal management. It&amp;rsquo;s both a good thing and a challenge if you&amp;rsquo;re remote - there&amp;rsquo;s no
central person to contact regarding&amp;hellip; pretty much anything, which can be strange, but on the
plus side you get to locate and talk to lots of individuals about what they work on and what
they care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much travel is involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 5 years of doing advocacy I have been to quite a lot of conferences.  Every year I
say I&amp;rsquo;ll do less, and every year I end up doing much more than I expected. Last year I &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo;
did 7 events, and I was unable fly/on maternity leave for nearly 3 months.  That&amp;rsquo;s slightly more
than the one-every-other-month I wanted to do, but quite a bit less than previous years.  This year
I&amp;rsquo;m currently signed up for only two conferences, I expect that to at least double by the end of
the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone travels as much as me though, Hadi and I probably travel more than any of the
others.  Advocacy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be spending your whole life racking up air miles, and at
JetBrains how much travel you do is entirely up to you. I choose which conferences to submit to,
I choose which ones to go to when I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited. I can ask for guidance on which ones may be
valuable to JetBrains, but ultimately the decision to travel is mine (now all the conference
organisers who I&amp;rsquo;ve said &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to probably feel aggrieved I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go to theirs - I&amp;rsquo;m so
sorry, but I won&amp;rsquo;t spend my whole life on a plane. Or, more likely, sat in the lounge in
Madrid/Barcelona/London/Amsterdam/Paris waiting for a connecting flight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect our technical writers won&amp;rsquo;t have to travel at all, except perhaps occasionally to the
office to connect with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s it like working remotely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit everyone.  And there&amp;rsquo;s a skill to it too.  I tend to like to work
10ish-6ish because if I don&amp;rsquo;t work normal office hours I&amp;rsquo;m worried I won&amp;rsquo;t be doing enough. I
also track how much time I spend on things, mostly to see where all my time is spent on those
weeks where I feel like I haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JetBrains uses Slack a lot, so us remote people do have a direct line to what&amp;rsquo;s going on, even
into the teams that are all sat together in an office.  The Developer Advocates have our own
Slack channel, of course, and that tends to be full of &amp;ldquo;witty banter&amp;rdquo; / water cooler conversation.
It&amp;rsquo;s also the first place I go to ask questions about anything, and I&amp;rsquo;m no longer scared of
looking stupid if I ask a &amp;ldquo;dumb&amp;rdquo; question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/adjusting_to_working_remotely&#34;&gt;worked remotely in the past&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s better here than
other places because JetBrains
understands there are remote workers and that we have rights and needs. It&amp;rsquo;s also good for me
because I&amp;rsquo;m in Europe, so although I&amp;rsquo;m physically separate at least I don&amp;rsquo;t have the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/tales_from_the_other_side_confessions_of_an_offshore_resource/&#34;&gt;timezone problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is great for flexibility, of course.  And although I do try to work 10-6ish, in
my office upstairs where the children can&amp;rsquo;t get to me, I am around if one of them needs me
immediately. I also don&amp;rsquo;t have a commute, so my hours are a lot shorter than if I worked (for
example) in London. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I could have gone back to work after just 4 months of
maternity leave if I had to work in an office - I&amp;rsquo;m still breastfeeding and this would have been
impossible if I didn&amp;rsquo;t work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this has its pros and cons, working at home also comes with distractions (although it&amp;rsquo;s
nice to be able to get the laundry done throughout the week rather than have to do it all at the
weekend). Pros: a good excuse for a nice computer and exactly the desk / chair / office setup
you want; close to the family and much more available than in an office. Cons: can be quite
isolated, can be easily distracted, can be quite noisy (currently both the 5-month-old and the
two-year-old are crying: is OK to be writing a blog now, would be a terrible time to record a
screencast).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote working is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/adjusting_to_working_remotely&#34;&gt;big topic of its own&lt;/a&gt;.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve done it before, you know the deal.  And
JetBrains is better than most places because they recognise us as real workers. But also probably
because the whole team is remote, so it&amp;rsquo;s not just one or two people cut off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of working on an employee handbook which will help us remote people a lot
too, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of knowledge stored in people&amp;rsquo;s brains that isn&amp;rsquo;t documented anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the team like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a dozen or so advocates on the team, all with different technology backgrounds and
covering different tools.  Hadi and Svetlana cover Kotlin, which also tends to overlap with
IntelliJ IDEA. I do IntelliJ IDEA (I guess I&amp;rsquo;m the main IDEA advocate, I do all the release
material etc) and I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who really does Upsource, and have so far been nearly 100%
Java-the-language. Anton does TeamCity and because he&amp;rsquo;s Java &amp;amp; Kotlin there&amp;rsquo;s some overlap there
with IntelliJ IDEA.  Other team members cover C++, Python, Go, .NET, Web technologies (this last
is an area we&amp;rsquo;re looking for specific expertise) and related tools (Resharper, Rider, GoLand,
CLion, PyCharm, WebStorm) and I have probably forgotten a load of them too. I see us as
individuals doing a similar job but with surprisingly little overlap. This is one reason being
remote actually works for us, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to co-ordinate much. But we are trying to get better
at reusing stuff between tools, and/or taking other people&amp;rsquo;s ideas and content and reworking it
for our communities (for example, I stole a load of Paul&amp;rsquo;s PyCharm
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DriveToDevelop&#34;&gt;tip tweets&lt;/a&gt; and did them for
IntelliJ IDEA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the team is somewhere up in the late thirties.  I myself am just about to
cross into the 40s - eeeek!  We&amp;rsquo;re all experienced developers with an interest in our
technologies and communities.  We&amp;rsquo;re laid back and passionate, which sounds like a weird
combination but works
well for us. There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a stupid question in our team, and even though we don&amp;rsquo;t
work super closely on everything, we all support each other and do our best to make the team
happy and productive.  We definitely have room for improvement for working together (Gary and I
had fun recording our &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/o-2fvj7GsOQ&#34;&gt;series of Git videos&lt;/a&gt; but we haven&amp;rsquo;t managed
to do anything similar since)
but it&amp;rsquo;s not because we don&amp;rsquo;t want to work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the good parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking my own code projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning new technologies and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where I live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the bad parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having enough time to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning new technologies and tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  The plus sides are also the downsides.  I probably don&amp;rsquo;t have to explain why, but if anyone
is interested in the specifics drop a note in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are we looking for in a developer advocate / technical writer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all sparked by our need to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/company/jobs/&#34;&gt;hire a couple of people&lt;/a&gt;, and wanting to be really transparent
about what the role was like, ideally to attract people who might not have considered this role
for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JetBrains is currently
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/company/jobs/&#34;&gt;hiring a bunch of people&lt;/a&gt;, but the two roles that
sparked this whole
conversation are a Web Technologies Developer Advocate and an Engineering Technical Writer. I&amp;rsquo;m
not the one making the hiring decisions, and on top of that there&amp;rsquo;s no real hard and fast rules
about what makes a good hire into these roles, but I think these things are interesting to
us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you will have at least 10 years of experience as a developer. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have
been an architect/tech lead or other &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; role, but you do need to have a very good
understanding of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a developer, what the pain points are for people in this
role, how developers use technology and how they learn it.  In our
writing / presentations / screencasts we try to present information in a way that makes
developers awesome at their jobs (see Kathy Sierra&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2EdyIOH&#34;&gt;Badass: Making Users Awesome&lt;/a&gt;), which means our content is usually
pretty technical and targeted at developers.  Having a good chunk of experience as a developer in
the real working world makes this substantially easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use our tools. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible for anyone to learn on the job.  As developers this is
pretty much all we do.  But it&amp;rsquo;s going to be much easier for you to talk about how our tools make
developer&amp;rsquo;s lives easier / improve people&amp;rsquo;s productivity if you&amp;rsquo;ve actually used the tools in
real life,
have really felt their benefits, and have a good enough understanding of how to use
them to look like a power user (at least in the context you&amp;rsquo;ll be showing them). You don&amp;rsquo;t have
to have used all of our tools all of the time, but to be a developer advocate of a particular
IDE, you really should have used that IDE to code in the day job and have used it as more than
just a text editor&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you&amp;rsquo;ll have some public profile that demonstrates you are not only interested in some
technology community (ideally the one we&amp;rsquo;re hiring for, e.g. web technologies) but are active in
that community.  We&amp;rsquo;re not looking for Rock Star Ninja Fully-Established Famous Developers.  But
this role is very much about being visible to developers, so it would be nice to see that you are
capable of interacting with other techies in a community.  What do I mean by this? I mean you
don&amp;rsquo;t have to have tens of thousands of followers on Twitter &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; thousands of points on
StackOverflow &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have been speaking at conferences for years &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be the leader of a user
group &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have an established blog &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; have written a book.
What we would like to see though is maybe one (or more) of the following (there may be other
types of public (or public-ish) activity which is just as good.  The key point is that you are
involved in your community in some way&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have presented at a conference or user group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active involvement in User Group(s) - e.g. organiser, regular presenter, active on mailing
list etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a technical blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a profile on StackOverflow which demonstrates the ability to provide valuable answers to
questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a GitHub (or similar) profile which showcases involvement in open source code and/or has
demo projects / code that other developers have found useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a Twitter profile that shows an interest in relevant technologies, and that you post
content that&amp;rsquo;s valuable to other developers (e.g. re-tweeting/linking to interesting content)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related to point three, you have to be able to demonstrate truly excellent communication
skills.  I have been involved in hiring developers at all sorts of organisations, and
communication skills is always seen as an important part of the role.  But for a role like this,
the job is almost entirely about communicating to people: to developers / architects / even
management about why and how to use our tools, and between you and the product marketing managers
for
the tool you&amp;rsquo;re the advocate for (more on that above).  Add to that the fact that we are
largely remote, it&amp;rsquo;s that much more difficult both to express what we mean to our colleagues and
to get a feel for what our colleagues are trying to tell us. You need to be able to communicate
potentially very technical ideas to other techies, you may need to be able to understand process
and talk about how a tool fits into a process (or what process works for a tool set), you need to
be able to work out with potentially multiple stakeholders what your priorities are and talk
honestly to set expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to be self-managed.  We&amp;rsquo;re experienced people who are grown up enough to make our own
decisions.  We manage our own priorities, with input from stakeholders. We can ping the Boss Person
to ask for help, opinions, input, and he&amp;rsquo;s always, always there to help unblock us, give us
advice, point us to the right place/person.  He will NOT be going through our backlog and
prioritising work for us, setting deadlines, or demanding anything from us. Our job is to keep
users, customers, and the product owners happy, and we&amp;rsquo;re trusted to get on with that with the
full support of the team and leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call to women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to do this because I hate trying to suggest that different
genders have different needs by singling out a particular gender. I also have found that my
advice &amp;ldquo;for women&amp;rdquo; works really well for almost everyone anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do very specifically want to talk to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; if you are a woman developer (or other minority,
but I can only speak from my experience of being a woman) and are even vaguely interested in
developer advocacy as a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think you maybe could do this, but you&amp;rsquo;re not ready yet, you probably are ready. For
every time you&amp;rsquo;ve thought you couldn&amp;rsquo;t present at a conference, think of those talks you&amp;rsquo;ve seen
where you&amp;rsquo;ve though &amp;ldquo;I could do that. I could do better than that&amp;rdquo;. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be
perfect straight away and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be better than everyone immediately. You simply
have to be good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You already have the skills you need for managing the social media side of this job.  I had an
excellent question last week on Twitter about how I handle the fact that my Twitter feed is
effectively a public representation of JetBrains as a company. And I realised I don&amp;rsquo;t freak out
about this - partly because JetBrains is really cool about &amp;ldquo;the voice&amp;rdquo; of the company and is
happy to have us just being ourselves, but mostly because as a woman, particularly a woman
developer, I am already super-conscious of what I post, how I word things, how I appear on
social media. Doing this as a job required almost zero adjustment for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My experience in the Java/JVM community has shown me being a woman is a massive advantage for
things like getting in to speak at conferences.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the programme committee for a
couple of conferences, and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the CFPs generally dominated by submissions from men. We&amp;rsquo;ve
actively looked for those from women and generally said &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; to them unless there was a
compelling reason not to.  You will often get emails from conference organisers saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d
really love for you to submit to this conference because we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough women speakers&amp;rdquo;,
and while that particular approach makes me roll my eyes (what, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the
content, you just care about having a woman&amp;rsquo;s face somewhere on your website?) it is something you
can use to your advantage. And to be fair, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t invite you if you were crap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re worried about being taken seriously as a developer when you&amp;rsquo;re a woman, I can tell
you from my own personal experience that being semi-famous in this space has reduced the number
of &amp;ldquo;are you a real developer?&amp;rdquo; questions at conferences and events to zero. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got
&amp;ldquo;speaker&amp;rdquo; on your lanyard, if you&amp;rsquo;ve just given a live demo showing you can code, you no longer
have to prove yourself to anyone, it&amp;rsquo;s out there for everyone to see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to draw attention to this side of things because I don&amp;rsquo;t want you to worry about
it if you hadn&amp;rsquo;t already thought about it, but it&amp;rsquo;s something that I was scared of right at the
beginning: I was worried I might get shit over Twitter or on the blog for being a woman.  So far
(fingers crossed) I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the sort of thing I was afraid of. I do get mansplained at
sometimes, and I do have to respond to idiots on Twitter.  But a) I see my (white, male)
colleagues suffering the same thing all the time and b) my team, JetBrains and even my Twitter
followers etc have my back.  I have a support network.  The fear is still real though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are more of us doing this job, there will be fewer people looking at the single woman
developer thinking she represents all women developers.  If half a dozen women&amp;rsquo;s voices are out
there, it becomes clearer we don&amp;rsquo;t all want the same things or work the same way, And That&amp;rsquo;s OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a woman developer and are considering applying for this role, I urge you to please
apply.  And if you have any questions, queries, doubts etc, please do contact me directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d really love to see more applications from women developers. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say we discourage
or dislike applications from men or that we&amp;rsquo;ll reject you if you&amp;rsquo;re not female, but if you are a
woman developer and are even marginally interested in this role, please, please go for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It&#39;s not generous at all, it&#39;s totally self-serving for JetBrains since we&#39;re trying
 to hire developer advocates and technical writers&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I was a power user of IntelliJ IDEA, and I had done live coding demos with it in the 
past when I joined, and that was probably a large part of why I was hired.  However, I hadn&#39;t used 
Upsource or TeamCity before I came to JetBrains and I have done advocacy for both
tools, so you don&#39;t need to be an expert in all JB tools. But the fact that I 
had used other code review tools before and felt a LOT of pain while using them made Upsource a 
joy to advocate, since it fixes so many of the pain points I&#39;ve felt with other tools.  And the 
fact that I&#39;ve worked in Continuous Delivery environments, and had experience with Jenkins, also 
made it easier for me to see where TeamCity fits, what it does well, why you might use it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Now I have children I seriously appreciate that physically getting out to user group 
events or 
conferences is very challenging for developers who are parents.  That&#39;s why this list also includes 
things which are a little easier to do on what can laughably be called the &#34;spare time&#34; when the
children aren&#39;t demanding 100% of your attention, e.g. blogs/Twitter/StackOverflow/mailing lists. </description>

            <title>Is boilerplate code really so bad?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/boilerplate/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/boilerplate/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting staying up to date with the evolution of Java and the myriad other JVM languages.  Is it worth it? What
do modern languages give us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many JVM languages promote &amp;ldquo;less boilerplate code&amp;rdquo; as one of their selling points. Even updates to Java in recent years
have removed unnecessary syntax. While this is clearly meant to be a Good Thing, many of us - particularly if we&amp;rsquo;ve been writing Java for a long time - think &amp;ldquo;so what?&amp;rdquo;. Our IDEs can generate code, and our brains get used to ignoring the stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the removal of extraneous code from the syntax of a language necessary, or just a gimmick? How does it impact our
ability to write and read code?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this talk, Trisha will explore common coding scenarios using Java and Kotlin. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what a language designed for
developer productivity looks like: what&amp;rsquo;s important for developers to write (and, more importantly, read) and what can
be removed. We&amp;rsquo;ll also see how Java has evolved to improve our productivity as producers and consumers of code, and why staying up to date with the features of a language like Java can ultimately make your life easier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Real World Java 9</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/real_world_java_9/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;How is Java 9 going to change the way developers work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature we always hear about whenever Java 9 is in the news is Jigsaw, modularity.  But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t scratch the same developer itch that Java 8&amp;rsquo;s lambdas and streams did, and we&amp;rsquo;re left with a vague sensation that the next version might not be that interesting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java 9 actually has a lot of great additions and changes to make development a bit nicer.  These features can&amp;rsquo;t be lumped under an umbrella term like Java 8&amp;rsquo;s lambdas and streams, the changes are scattered throughout the APIs and language features that we regularly use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this presentation Trisha will show, via live coding:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the Java Platform Module System is and how to make your code modular&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The improvements to the Streams API that make it easier to control infinite streams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the Collections convenience methods simplify code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Along the way we&amp;rsquo;ll bump into other Java 9 features, including some of the additions to interfaces and Optional, and a number of other small changes that make coding in Java a bit nicer than it was before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all the available videos, with the most recent at the top.  Usually, the more recent the talk the more polished, therefore usually they&amp;rsquo;re better.  With this talk, it&amp;rsquo;s more a case of showcasing / focusing on different aspects in different versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqmQ_0tV978&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This JetBrains webinar is the most up-to-date version of the talk, and includes more Java 9 features than any of the
others, including a quick look at JShell. It has almost no content on Reactive Streams though, so check out one of
the other videos if this is what you&amp;rsquo;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/QAssmRMXMXo&#34;&gt;vJUG, September 2017&lt;/a&gt;.  Lucky to have 90 minutes to cover the material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/watS54iWH9U&#34;&gt;GOTO Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;. Less reactive streams, less Jigsaw, marginally more time for the &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; Java 9 features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/wZLDDx-5KJg&#34;&gt;J on the Beach, Malaga&lt;/a&gt;. Pretty much the same as the DevoxxUK version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/GkP83hvdeMk&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;. More focus on Jigsaw / Java Modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/java9-flow-stream-api&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;. Much more focus on Reactive Streams: what they are, how they work, and how to migrate an app to use the Reactive Streams API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slides&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/5WKfdU7WjMOQkd&#34; width=&#34;595&#34; height=&#34;485&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the latest slides.  For earlier versions, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/&#34;&gt;Slideshare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this presentation was originally created to demonstrate Java 8 code in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt;, take a look at the videos there to see more background on the application and how it used Java 8 Streams and Lambda Expressions for the core business logic. The code and the presentation
evolved &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/sKozumGWAOo&#34;&gt;to include some Java 9 features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have another Java 9 talk based off this code, &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java_9_are_we_there_yet&#34;&gt;Anticipating Java 9 - Functionality and Tooling&lt;/a&gt;, which demos more individual Java 9 features and talks specifically about IntelliJ IDEA&amp;rsquo;s support for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;articles--more-detail&#34;&gt;Articles &amp;amp; More Detail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve expanded upon the examples in this presentation in a couple of articles about adopting Java 9:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Magazine: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javamagazine.mozaicreader.com/JulyAug2017#&amp;amp;pageSet=17&amp;amp;page=0&#34;&gt;Migrating from Java 8 to Java 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;JetBrains Blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/10/real-world-java-9/&#34;&gt;Real World Java 9 Summary and FAQs&lt;/a&gt;
in this blog post I answer audience questions about the module system mostly, some questions relate to other Java 9
features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense-nine&#34;&gt;https://github.com/trishagee/sense-nine&lt;/a&gt;.
The full application with all Java 9 code is currently under the
&lt;em&gt;working-system&lt;/em&gt; branch, the presentation builds off the code in &lt;em&gt;start_point&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original Java 8 code comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense&#34;&gt;https://github.com/trishagee/sense&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; branch has the most up-to-date final working Java 8 application.  JUnit 5 tests come from the &lt;em&gt;junit-5&lt;/em&gt; branch. Java 8 and 9 features live side-by-side in &lt;em&gt;yow-brisbane&lt;/em&gt;. That app was built with Java build 9-ea+146, but does not work with build 9-ea+156&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intellij-idea&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest version of this talk runs on IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1, which supports
Jigsaw much better than pre-2017 versions.  However, I&amp;rsquo;m currently using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/&#34;&gt;2017.3 EAP&lt;/a&gt;, as this has the best support for Java 9/JPMS
and also a basic version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-161611&#34;&gt;Java Console&lt;/a&gt;.
Read a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/09/java-9-and-intellij-idea/&#34;&gt;summary of the Java 9 support in IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Becoming Fully Buzzword Compliant</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you keep your skills up to date in this fast-moving and turbulant
industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re at this conference to hear all about “best practices”, the latest trends in technology, and presumably to
level up your own career.  But it’s a tall order, learning to be a fully buzzword compliant developer, architect or
lead, especially when What’s Hot changes on practically a daily basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During this talk, Trisha will give an irreverent overview of the current technical landscape and present a survival
guide for those who want to stay ahead in this turbulent industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java_9_are_we_there_yet/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead to what functionality is available in Java 9, and IntelliJ IDEA&amp;rsquo;s support (current and future) for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seems like we’ve been waiting for Java 9 for eternity.  We’ve been hearing all about Jigsaw since Java 7, so we’ll be forgiven for thinking that’s the most interesting thing about the next Java release.  What we should be wondering is, will Java 9 it change the way we develop, like Java 8 did?  Will my tools break when I try to use it? Is it worth playing with it before it comes out, or should I just wait until everything stabilises?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this talk, Trisha will take a look at some of the features in Java 9, including modularity, the REPL, and the nice new Collections features.  Trisha will demonstrate, via live coding, these features in IntelliJ IDEA, and talk a bit about the current and future support for Java 9 in IntelliJ IDEA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://jdk.java.net/9/&#34;&gt;Download the latest Java JDK here&lt;/a&gt; (the
talk uses build 161).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2017/03/support-for-java-9-modules-in-intellij-idea-2017-1/&#34;&gt;introduced basic support for modules&lt;/a&gt;.
This support has evolved a little since then, I&amp;rsquo;m now using the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/&#34;&gt;2017.2 EAP&lt;/a&gt; to get the best support for Java 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jigsaw code I used was from a workshop by Brian Goetz.  But to start playing with Jigsaw, take a look at
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/quick-start&#34;&gt;Getting Started tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.  I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/downloads/adoptopenjdk/REPL_Tutorial.pdf&#34;&gt;Java REPL
Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to help me get started with JShell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;help--feedback&#34;&gt;Help &amp;amp; Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get help and more information on JDK 9 from the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.oracle.com/community/java/java_desktop/java-se-early-access&#34;&gt;Oracle Community feedback forum&lt;/a&gt;. If you find a genuine
bug in the JDK, &lt;a href=&#34;http://bugreport.java.com/&#34;&gt;report it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can report bugs and request features for IntelliJ IDEA in

            <title>What Can Men Do</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_can_men_do/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_can_men_do/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote a long email to the London Java Community in answer to an excellent question: &amp;ldquo;What can men do to support Women in Technology?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a brain dump, by no means comprehensive, and is in answer to a specific question in a specific context, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked
to make the information public so it can be useful in a broader context.  So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know one of the reasons men feel strongly about this topic is because they do want to help and don&amp;rsquo;t always know how, and can feel
excluded when it&amp;rsquo;s just presented as a women&amp;rsquo;s issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said in the past, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; was the community that mentored me, and those mentors
were largely men: Barry, Martijn, Ben Evans, John Stevenson to name a few. These guys were not only open and friendly and willing to
listen to me, they pushed me (hard!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers, of course, and there are lots of blogs and articles on the internet about this topic (if anyone finds any
they like, feel free to post as a comment for all to see), but for me personally, my male mentors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listened&lt;/em&gt; to me, and made me feel like I had a valid opinion.  They took things I said, assumed they were a valid hypothesis, and
made changes based on what I&amp;rsquo;d said.  I never felt like I had to change myself to fit in to the community.  Barry etc added different
types of events and different approaches to running events in order to accommodate feedback I&amp;rsquo;d given.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pushed&lt;/em&gt; me - Barry included me in the Associates, simultaneously recognising my value to the community but also forcing me to be
more active in running it and applying changes I thought were important.  Martijn and Ben practically forced me to give short
presentations at the LJC well before I was ready. But they also gave me loads of support, suggesting topics, checking through my slides
in advance, giving me presentation hints and tips when I asked for them. They were right, I was ready, even when I felt like I wasn&amp;rsquo;t.
I&amp;rsquo;ve talked before about &lt;a href=&#34;becoming_an_evangelist&#34;&gt;how this helped my career&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Validated&lt;/em&gt; me - By co-presenting with me, these men who were more well known (maybe even respected ;) ) in the community (not just
the LJC, but the global Java Community) not only gave me support to launch my own presenting career, but they also validated, there on
stage, that I was someone to listen to.  Martin Thompson, Todd Montgomery, Dan North, as well as those I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned have all gone out
of their way to co-present with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in answer to the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re interested in supporting a Women in [some technology] group specifically, please do reach out to the organiser. Check what 
 the goals are for the community, and offer support.&lt;/li&gt;  
 &lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re interested in supporting women in technology generally (or specific women you know), read the following points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;: When you see a woman at a technical event (community, conference, etc) &lt;em&gt;assume she&amp;rsquo;s a techie&lt;/em&gt;.  I cannot tell
you
the number of times a man I was talking to at an LJC event assumed I was a recruiter or in HR because I was female.  It is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; better to
assume the woman is a techie and be corrected if she is not, than to assume the other way around.  And, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; assume she is a
competent, senior techie.  Again, much better for a student to correct you and tell you she&amp;rsquo;s junior, than for you to assume a seasoned
architect is junior just because she&amp;rsquo;s female.  This is by far the easiest thing for you to change in your behaviour, and probably the
most valuable thing you can do for the community to encourage women to simply turn up and keep turning up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know someone who&amp;rsquo;s interested in presenting, suggest she co-presents with you at a User Group event, internal company brown
bag, community conference, etc.  This is a great way to get started.  Or suggest she does a lightning talk at a User Group (some
conferences also offer Quickies for inexperienced speakers). If your local user group doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently do lightning talks, I&amp;rsquo;m sure they
can be started if there&amp;rsquo;s interest.  If you have the expertise, offer to check slides, and/or be there for a run-though of the talk
in advance.  This can even be over Skype or hangouts, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to take loads of time to travel to meet in person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know women who you think would be great at writing, but who haven&amp;rsquo;t started their own blog yet, offer a place for them to write
for/with you. If you have a blog, they can write a guest post for you.  Again, offer to check the content before it goes live.  All of us
are super nervous about our stuff being &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;, receiving the green light from someone else is a nice confidence boost and helps
us feel better about publishing something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentor a woman. This is for anyone, male, female, non-gender-specific. Mentoring includes some of the activities mentioned above. Or
it can be something more code-focused.  Or helping them learn to play the politics of career (and believe me, techie roles and
companies are still full of politics, especially if you want to get promoted). In fact, I recently read that what&amp;rsquo;s really needed for
women is Sponsorship, not Mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;male mentors tend to sponsor rather than just mentor—similar to the difference between coaching
and selling. In fact&amp;hellip; women may actually be over-mentored, but under-sponsored. And that sponsoring—advocating to get somebody a job
or promotion, mentioning their name in an appointments meeting, actively helping that person advance—is what makes the real difference
in women helping women get ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/peggydrexler/2014/03/04/can-women-succeed-without-a-mentor/#513dc3b542f6&#34;&gt;Forbes: Can Women Succeed Without A Mentor?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have to be senior and visible (either in the community or in your organisation) to sponsor, but it makes a big difference to women&amp;rsquo;s
careers. I remember the one time I had a male sponsor in one of my jobs is the only time I got a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just be encouraging.  And while I personally have a real problem with being encouraging without sounding patronising (I dunno how to
say something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound patronising!), it&amp;rsquo;s really important you try to be positive without being patronising or mentioning
something gender related.  I&amp;rsquo;ve heard comments like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20120409030606/http://www.thedeveloperday.com/my-top-5-qcon-london-2012-talks/&#34;&gt;it would be enough to say this talk was delivered by a beautiful lady packed with a
room of geeks but it deserves more praise&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
(er, thanks?) and &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s so great to hear women give technical
presentations!&amp;rdquo;.  Hmm. I know that&amp;rsquo;s trying to be supportive but it does make you feel a bit&amp;hellip; like an outsider, some sort of weird zoo
animal. So, before you open your mouth, This One Simple Trick Can Save You From Embarrassment: would you say this to a man? If it would
sound silly aimed at a male, re-phrase it until it sounds sensible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re in a position to give feedback (e.g. at work a direct report, 360 reviews, or in the community someone who requests
feedback), give actionable feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that women receive more &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/04/research-vague-feedback-is-holding-women-back&#34;&gt;vague feedback&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://fortune.com/2014/08/26/performance-review-gender-bias/&#34;&gt;personality criticism&lt;/a&gt; in
performance evaluations, whereas men receive actionable advice tied to business outcomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/the-real-reason-women-quit-tech-and-how-to-address-it-6dfb606929fd#.a1hn4ztpy&#34;&gt;The Real Reason Women Quit Tech And How To Address It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you can imagine, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to improve with clear, actionable advice than with vague feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really importantly, if a woman enjoys being technical, encourage her to stay technical.  Just because she has people skills as well doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean she should be promoted away from code to management, or moved into a Scrum Master position.  Just because she&amp;rsquo;s a woman presenting or writing about technology, does not mean she wants to present or write about being a woman in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned it, but this is excellent:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/the-real-reason-women-quit-tech-and-how-to-address-it-6dfb606929fd#.a1hn4ztpy&#34;&gt;The Real Reason Women Quit Tech And How To Address It&lt;/a&gt;.
It contains links to tonnes of research in this area.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/ideacast/2010/08/women-are-over-mentored-but-un.html&#34;&gt;Women Are Over-Mentored (But Under-Sponsored)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women?referral=00134&#34;&gt;Why Men Still Get More Promotions Than Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far&amp;hellip;. well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do all these things.  But if you do care about diversity (and in my experience, I&amp;rsquo;ve met more white men who care about
diversity than women who care about it, cos being a minority is sometimes helpful), read these and do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s just
that thing of assuming a woman you meet at a tech event is, in fact, a techie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS if you are a woman in technology and want to ask me anything, please feel free to drop me a line at any time. I have HORRIBLE e-mail
latency but I will answer you eventually :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ZeroTurnaround&amp;rsquo;s rather excellent (and extensive!) article &lt;a href=&#34;https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/getting-started-with-intellij-idea-as-an-eclipse-user/4/&#34;&gt;Getting Started With IntelliJ IDEA as an Eclipse User&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/eq3KiAH4IBI&#34;&gt;42 IntelliJ IDEA Tips and Tricks&lt;/a&gt;. Watch this.  Regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have IntelliJ IDEA power users near you, get them to install &lt;a href=&#34;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7345&#34;&gt;Presentation Assistant&lt;/a&gt; so you can see all the shortcuts they&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want, you can also use the Eclipse keymap and the Eclipse compiler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an extensive JetBrains article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/eclipse.html&#34;&gt;Migrating from Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out

&lt;li&gt;Some of my own presentations are live coding using lots of IntelliJ IDEA features, watching them might give an
idea of what&amp;rsquo;s possible.  For example
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw&#34;&gt;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB All Together&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8&#34;&gt;Refactoring to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few tutorials about specific topics performed in IntelliJ IDEA:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-introduction-to-refactoring.html&#34;&gt;Introduction to Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-test-driven-development.html&#34;&gt;Test Driven Development&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-migrating-to-java-8.html&#34;&gt;Migrating to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the slides above, there&amp;rsquo;s a section &amp;ldquo;The Power of IntelliJ IDEA&amp;rdquo; with no content - that&amp;rsquo;s because that&amp;rsquo;s a place
for a live demo of working with IntelliJ IDEA. To create that demo, I jotted down some topics that I think are
interesting in IntelliJ IDEA, which are worth making a note of here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IntelliJ provides &lt;em&gt;Contextual Aid&lt;/em&gt; - hints, tips, help and advice at the point at which you need it.  For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/auto-completing-code.html&#34;&gt;Code completion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magic Alt+Enter to show &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/intention-actions.html&#34;&gt;intention actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/using-postfix-templates.html&#34;&gt;Postfix completion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/gutter-icons.html?search=gutter%20icons&#34;&gt;Gutter icons&lt;/a&gt;, such as
icons to run tests, show implementations of a method, display the Functional Interface for a lambda expression,
etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/code-inspection.html&#34;&gt;Inspections&lt;/a&gt; are automatically run for the
current file and shown as warnings, which you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/resolving-problems.html&#34;&gt;usually fix with a quick fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/navigating-through-the-source-code.html&#34;&gt;Navigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/live-templates.html&#34;&gt;Live templates&lt;/a&gt;  might be one of my favourite
features - both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radcortez.com/getting-started-with-intellij-idea-live-templates/&#34;&gt;built in&lt;/a&gt; (try &lt;code&gt;sout&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;soutp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;psvm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;itar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;iter&lt;/code&gt;)
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html#scratch&#34;&gt;custom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/refactoring-source-code.html&#34;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt; (check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-introduction-to-refactoring.html&#34;&gt;Refactoring
Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/code-inspection.html&#34;&gt;Inspections&lt;/a&gt; were mentioned above, but as well
as having the results on the current file, you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/customizing-profiles.html&#34;&gt;customise what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/a&gt; and
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/running-inspections.html&#34;&gt;scope to check&lt;/a&gt;.
They&amp;rsquo;re very powerful for helping to either keep your code clean, or improve it further. I&amp;rsquo;ve written a tutorial on
how to use them to help
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-migrating-to-java-8.html&#34;&gt;migrate your code to use Java 8 idioms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/debugging.html&#34;&gt;Debugger&lt;/a&gt; is powerful but easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the things you get from the Java side of the IDE is also available for other languages you might be using too,
e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/databases-and-sql.html&#34;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/javascript-specific-guidelines.html&#34;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/editing-html-files.html&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, etc. E.g. code completion,
refactoring and debugging, where appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/vcs-specific-procedures.html&#34;&gt;VCS support&lt;/a&gt; is sufficient for most
everyday use, and every new release adds more features.  If in the past the VCS support didn&amp;rsquo;t do what you
wanted, give it another try now, it&amp;rsquo;s constantly evolving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also interesting for most developers is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/gradle.html&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/maven.html&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; integration, and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/testing.html&#34;&gt;running tests&lt;/a&gt; with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/code-coverage.html&#34;&gt;code coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>JavaZone 2016</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_2016/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_2016/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a conference write up.  The short version of &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; is because I got a bit bored of doing it.  Plus, I
found I was attending conferences as a speaker &amp;ldquo;on the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting
to other attendees to see what they&amp;rsquo;re up to and so forth, didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out
whether a conference is worth attending from a content or atmosphere point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel compelled to blog about &lt;a href=&#34;https://2016.javazone.no/&#34;&gt;JavaZone&lt;/a&gt;. I presented there back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_oslo&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, but every year since then haven&amp;rsquo;t
made it for one reason or another (the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s near my birthday in no way impacts my scheduling…).  I made the effort this year, and
I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been to many more conferences, of various sizes, various themes, all around the world, and I can definitely
state that JavaZone is up there as one of the best conferences around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content is great, JavaZone manages to attract a lot of great speakers who can present on topics that range from &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/181814364&#34;&gt;deeply
technical&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/181925281&#34;&gt;more theoretical&lt;/a&gt; to concepts
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/182087729&#34;&gt;beyond just code and syntax&lt;/a&gt;.  They also really make an effort to encourage local presenters, and to offer
the option of lightning talks. I love this from the point of view of encouraging more from the community to get involved and present themselves, but also because you get more novel content - experience reports from developers deep in the trenches; teams who can tell you what they&amp;rsquo;ve found trying to implement things that we hear about at conferences; and other things from the point of view of real developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Food and fantastic coffee](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.45.36-coffee.jpg &amp;ldquo;Food and fantastic coffee&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food is fantastic, and available all day.  I made half of a promise to myself not to rate conferences on the quality of the food
after I had a glimpse at how insanely hard it is for conference organisers to balance the requirements of keeping ticket costs low,
using an adequate venue in an accessible location, and providing some sort of catering through the day.  Especially when venues
themselves often restrict this.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how JavaZone do it, but now I&amp;rsquo;m aware of all these issues, I&amp;rsquo;m even more impressed at the
variety and quality of their food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Robots](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.46.02-robots.jpg &amp;ldquo;Robots&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The venue.  The location in the centre of Oslo is nice, often conference venues are out of town, making them hard to get to or, if
you&amp;rsquo;re staying near there, terribly isolated.  One of the reasons to travel to a conference is to see the city, and you get a chance to
do that at JavaZone. So it&amp;rsquo;s central, easy to get to, with plenty of great hotels nearby.  The venue itself also nicely laid out, with
presentation rooms circling a central exhibition space.  Which leads me to&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Exhibition](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 09.46.18-exhibition.jpg &amp;ldquo;The Exhibition&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exhibition space is brilliant.  Because it&amp;rsquo;s central, most people spend their time between sessions in the exhibition hall.  As
an exhibitor (JetBrains had a stand there), this is obviously useful to us, but as an attendee it’s nice to know there&amp;rsquo;s a place to go
to hang out where other people will also be hanging out.  Especially when the vibe of the hall was so much fun, so energetic.  And the
stands themselves were impressive: some bribing us with excellent coffee; several with lego areas inviting you to sit down and play;
interactive VR headsets; modern and retro gaming centres (curses, I forgot to take a photo); interactive quizzes and games… As for us,
we had a sofa, and I loved that, it felt welcoming and relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Games](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.45.20-games.jpg &amp;ldquo;Exhibition&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone is really friendly.  The crew and JUG people were easy to spot and friendly if you needed help. All attendees and speakers
were happy to strike up conversations short and long, on a variety of topics. People smiled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a big conference, there are a lot of attendees, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel big and daunting.  Instead, you get the benefit of 8 tracks
of varied content, but don&amp;rsquo;t feel lost in the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Overflow Room](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 09.39.20-overflow.jpg &amp;ldquo;Overflow Room&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overflow room is the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen at a conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m seriously wondering if I can set up something similar at
home (on a much smaller scale!) to let me skim content from multiple talks when I&amp;rsquo;m doing research, or maybe just something to have
half an eye on while I&amp;rsquo;m entertaining the minion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was, from my point of view as an attendee and speaker, incredibly well organised.  It felt smooth, and touches like the big
monitors flashing up relevant information was really nice.  I also loved that the video production quality and presentation of the
stages and so forth was really professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Plenty of caffeine for the developers](/static/images/javazone-2016/2016-09-08 15.46.36-stacks-coffee.jpg &amp;ldquo;Plenty of caffeine for the developers&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I personally think it&amp;rsquo;s brilliant that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/album/4133413&#34;&gt;videos are online&lt;/a&gt; really soon after you&amp;rsquo;ve presented.
Sometimes as a speaker you might want a delay on the video - conferences may be more likely to accept your talk if it&amp;rsquo;s not already widely available.  For me though,
especially when giving a new talk like we did here, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to see the video so soon afterwards, to see how it went and
learn from it.  For speakers just starting on their presenting career, it&amp;rsquo;s also great - you have a video to use in your &amp;ldquo;portfolio&amp;rdquo; to
help you get your talk(s) accepted at other conferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I can&amp;rsquo;t leave this without mentioning diversity.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;m a world-weary veteran of conferences, I&amp;rsquo;m fairly blind to gender
balance unless I specifically look, or something out of the ordinary catches my attention.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the percentages were, but
I noticed so many women at the conference, women who were clearly professionals attending the conference and not hired booth babes or
staff of some other kind.  It was obvious and pleasing.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how the other women attendees felt, if it was their first
conference maybe they still noticed there were fewer women than men, but the difference to me was that whichever direction I looked
in, there was at least &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; woman, usually more. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there are more women developers in Up North, or if it&amp;rsquo;s just a
conference that somehow appeals more to women than other conferences. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to find out if any special measures were taken
by the conference organisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know a bit more about conferences and how they work behind the scenes, I&amp;rsquo;m astounded at JavaZone.  It feels like  a lot of money has been spent getting it really right, and/or they&amp;rsquo;ve worked really hard to get the absolute most out of what budget they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to really hunt for a downside, it&amp;rsquo;s that all the free alcohol was beer and not wine.  Yep, a complaint about free beer.  But knowing how expensive wine is in Norway, I&amp;rsquo;m not at all surprised.  Plus, moaning about the exact type of free alcohol available seems churlish at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A code review is basically a technical discussion which should lead to improvements in the code and/or sharing
knowledge in a team. As with any conversation, it should have substance and form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s involved in a good code review? What kind of problems do we want to spot and address? Trisha Gee will talk
about things a reviewer may consider when looking at changes:  what potential issues to look for; why certain
patterns may be harmful; and, of course, what NOT to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to commenting on someone’s work, it may be hard to find the right words to convey a useful message
without offending the authors - after all, this is something that they worked hard on. Maria Khalusova will share
some observations, thoughts and practical tricks on how to give and receive feedback without turning a code review
into a battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Year? Really?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_a_year.md/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So I came to the blog to update my &lt;a href=&#34;//presentation/upcoming_events/&#34;&gt;upcoming events&lt;/a&gt; (at least something stays up to date) only to find
it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a year since I last blogged!  This is terrible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything in a year, it&amp;rsquo;s that a lot of my writing energy goes into
stuff for the actual day job.  Which is good, because that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what I wanted from the day job, but the blog makes it look like
I don&amp;rsquo;t write any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m going to cheat.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole series of articles off the back of last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger/&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Anger&lt;/a&gt; talk:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2015/10/30/five-java-8-features/&#34;&gt;Five Java 8 Features That You Won’t Be Able to Live Without&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/why-java-8-1&#34;&gt;Why Java 8?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-920950&#34;&gt;Java SE 8 in Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-test-driven-development.html&#34;&gt;TDD in IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. I have video
clips to turn this into a screencast as well, but that&amp;rsquo;s Yet Another thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on how IntelliJ IDEA helps you &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/tutorial-migrating-to-java-8.html&#34;&gt;migrate code to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.  This evolved into the other thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this year, my latest live demo
presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8/&#34;&gt;Refactoring to Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A whole series of blog posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/category/practices/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;What to look for in a code review&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This was fun and satisfying to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;which got &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/whattolookforinacodereview&#34;&gt;turned into a book&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m finally the author of a book!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2016/07/java-8-top-tips/&#34;&gt;Java 8 Top Tips&lt;/a&gt;, with a bunch of IntelliJ-specific tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve taken over &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/java-annotated/&#34;&gt;Java Annotated Monthly&lt;/a&gt;, so at least you get to hear from me
once a month with that. I try really hard not to be too sarcastic, jokey or British when I write the newsletter. I don&amp;rsquo;t always succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a bunch of screencasts &amp;amp; webinars for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/intellijideavideo/videos&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUa50f13M4v5Nvp6b-IBNB4e&#34;&gt;Upsource
and Team City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and I had a baby.  I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating blogging about being a working parent, but I&amp;rsquo;m a bit concerned that Of Course a woman is
going to blog about Being A Mother, when previously I just blogged about&amp;hellip; well, come to think about it I blogged about all sorts of
things, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_the_customer_isnt_always_right/&#34;&gt;haircuts&lt;/a&gt; and
[hangovers] (/post/what_my_hangovers_can_teach_you_about_agile/), so I guess I could probably get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Applying Java 8 Idioms to Existing Code</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/refactoring_to_java_8/</guid>
            <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how to improve performance with your Java code using Java 8 language features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn hands on techniques to discover and implement common Java 8 refactorings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand when you should and should not apply key refactorings in Java 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re drawing ever closer to Java 9, and even hearing about features in Java 10, many of us are still working with an older version. Even if your project has technically adopted Java 8, and even if you’re using it when coding new features, it’s likely that the majority of your code base is still not making the most of what’s available in Java 8 - features like Lambda Expressions, the Streams API, and new Date/Time. And this is a shame, since Java 8 provides not only nicer syntax for developers, but (usually) better application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Trisha will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight the performance benefits of using Java 8 - after all, you’ll probably have to persuade &amp;ldquo;The Management&amp;rdquo; that tampering with
existing code is worthwhile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how to identify areas of code that can be updated to use Java 8 features, and how to pick which changes will give you the
most benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how to automatically refactor your code to make use of features like lambdas and streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover some of the pros and cons of using the new features - including suggestions of when refactoring may NOT be the best idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most complete version of the talk, containing as many different refactorings as I could squeeze in, and updated performance analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Article: [Java performance tutorial: How fast are the Java 8 streams? - Angelika Langer](https://jaxenter
.com/java-performance-tutorial-how-fast-are-the-java-8-streams-118830.html) Notable Quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the for-loop is faster that the sequential stream operation, but the difference on an ArrayList is not nearly as significant as
it was on an array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find that there is no measurable difference any more between for-loop and sequential stream if the functionality is heavily cpu
bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point to take home is that sequential streams are no faster than loops. If you use sequential streams then you don’t do it for
performance reasons; you do it because you like the functional programming style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality check via our benchmark yields a ratio (sequential / parallel) of only 1.6 instead of 2.0, which illustrates the amount of
overhead that is involved in going parallel and how (well or poorly) it is overcompensated (on this particular platform).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind it is fair to say that the performance model of streams is not a trivial one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;you need to benchmark a lot in order to find out for a given context whether going parallel is worth doing or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realisation is: Yes, parallel stream operations are easy to use and often they run faster than sequential operations, but don’t
expect miracles. Also, don’t guess; instead, benchmark a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article: [Benchmark: How Misusing Streams Can Make Your Code 5 Times Slower](&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.takipi&#34;&gt;http://blog.takipi&lt;/a&gt;

interesting comparison of different iteration styles.  Also shows that things like boxing might add more cost than streams (but that you
don&amp;rsquo;t realise you&amp;rsquo;re boxing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a bunch of techniques to produce the benchmarks on the talk.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to summarise them more thoroughly when I get a chance, but
for now here&amp;rsquo;s my background reading:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dislike the term &amp;ldquo;Best Practice&amp;rdquo; as it implies a &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach, and I believe that our job is to
make difficult decisions based on various pros and cons and differing situations.  However, here I will collect
resources that may help us make some of those decisions&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Java 8 MOOC - Session 3 Summary</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session3/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session3/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the final get-together to discuss the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt;. Any
event hosted in August in a city that is regularly over 40°C is going to face challenges, so it was great that
we had attendees from earlier sessions plus new people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/java8mooc/lesson3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woohoo lambdas!&#34; title=&#34;Woohoo lambdas!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this session was to talk about Lesson 3, but also to wrap up the course as a whole: to talk about what we
liked and what we would have improved (about both the course itself and our user group events).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session2&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, let&amp;rsquo;s outline our
discussion areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#findAny--&#34;&gt;findAny()&lt;/a&gt;
vs &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#findFirst--&#34;&gt;findFirst()&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Why do we
need both of these methods, and when would you use them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;findFirst()&lt;/code&gt; is the deterministic version, which will return you the first element in the Stream (according to
encounter order - see the section on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;Ordering in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;).
So, regardless of whether you run the operation in parallel or serial, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; and use &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt;
with this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you&amp;rsquo;ll get the element at index 3 - the first &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; in the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;findAny()&lt;/code&gt; is non-deterministic, so will return you any element that matches your criteria - it could return the
element at index 3, or the one at position 6. Realistically, if the stream is on an ordered collection like a list,
when you run &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; on a sequential stream, I expect it will return the same result as &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt;.  The real
use-case for &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; is when you&amp;rsquo;re running this on a parallel stream. Let&amp;rsquo;s take the above list, and assume that
when you run this on a parallel stream it&amp;rsquo;s processed by two separate threads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;,    // processed by thread 1 
 &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]     // processed by thread 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible that thread 2 finds its &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; (the one at position 6) before thread 1 finds the one at position 3, so
this will be value that&amp;rsquo;s returned. By configuring the Stream to return any one of the values that matches the
criteria, you can potentially execute the operation faster when running in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; is (potentially) faster in parallel and (probably) returns the same value as &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; when running in
serial, why not use that all the time?  Well, there are times when you really do want the first item. If you have a
list of DVDs ordered by year the film was released, and you want to find the original &amp;ldquo;King Kong&amp;rdquo; (for
example), you&amp;rsquo;ll want &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; to find the one released in 1933, not the one that was released in 1976 or the
one from 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; is not always going to be slower than &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt;, even in parallel.  Going back to our list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[&amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Z&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;L&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;H&amp;quot;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to &lt;code&gt;findFirst&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;findAny&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;ldquo;H&amp;rdquo; could be the same performance for both methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collectors&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really see the big picture for collectors.  I&amp;rsquo;m perfectly content with
the built in collectors like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.toList())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.toSet())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see what they do, and work out when you need to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also very happy to have discovered &lt;code&gt;joining&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.joining(&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a super-useful way to create Comma Separated Values (CSVs) that I use in my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where things get a bit murky for me is where we start chaining up collectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collect(Collectors.mapping(...).combiner().andThen(...).apply(...))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(it should be obvious from my lack of clear example that I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% certain under which circumstances these are
useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a group, we think the chained collectors are kinda ugly - not because we&amp;rsquo;re against chaining (we like Streams),
but maybe because it&amp;rsquo;s another chain inside a param to a chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this is an area where some good, solid examples and a bit of daily use will make it much clearer to
developers. We hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this, the course didn&amp;rsquo;t go into creating your own collectors at all. My personal (under-informed) opinion
is that I guess most developers should be able to use either the out-of-the-box collectors (&lt;code&gt;toList&lt;/code&gt; etc) or use the
collector chaining to build what they need. If you need a custom collector, perhaps you haven&amp;rsquo;t considered everything
that&amp;rsquo;s already available to you. But as a group, we decided we would have liked to see this topic anyway so that we
could get a deeper understanding of what collectors are and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercises for lesson 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Well. What can we say? I really hope there are people reading this who haven&amp;rsquo;t finished
the course yet, because the Sevilla Java User group would like to say to you: don&amp;rsquo;t despair, the lesson 3 exercises
are &lt;em&gt;substantially&lt;/em&gt; harder than those for lessons 1 and 2. Honestly, the whole group considered it less of a learning
curve and more of a massive cliff to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://herbookthoughts.reads-it.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/d6a1143f571184db25f94613edd43b40af6d3a629221aba00d9efdcfef5efd84.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I have no idea what I am doing&#34; title=&#34;I have no idea 
what I am doing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it was great to have something so challenging to end on, but it probably would have been less ego-destroying
if we could have got up to that level gradually instead of having it sprung on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Part 2 of the lesson 3 exercises was that we had three very different answers to discuss
in the group. None of us were super happy with any of them, but we could see definite pros and cons of each approach,
and that&amp;rsquo;s something you really want to learn in a course like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also really great to have a rough performance test to run on your own computer, so that you could really see
the impact of your choices on the performance of the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m going to add a shameless plug to a friend&amp;rsquo;s book here. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about Java 8 for this course, for
my &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger&#34;&gt;Java 8 demo&lt;/a&gt;, and to generally get up to speed. My favourite book for getting to
grips with lambdas and streams
is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J3B3J3C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00J3B3J3C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=IX6U2YT4FADY4JY6&#34;&gt;Java 8 Lambdas: Pragmatic Functional Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00J3B3J3C&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;
by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RichardWarburto&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&lt;/a&gt;. This book also contains more info about collectors too,
so maybe some of our questions around how to use these in more complex situation are answered in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We really enjoyed the MOOC, and the sessions to get together to discuss it. We particularly liked that the meetups
were a safe place to ask questions and discuss alternative solutions, and that we weren&amp;rsquo;t expected to be genius-level
experts in order to participate fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If/when Oracle re-runs the MOOC, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to take part this time I highly recommend signing up.
And if you can find (or run) a local meetup to discuss it, it makes the experience much more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session2/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session2/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt;
is working towards completing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt; on
lambdas and streams. We&amp;rsquo;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
to share knowledge between people who are doing the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second week&amp;rsquo;s lesson was about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; - how you can use the
new stream API to transform data. There was also a whole section on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-optional-2175753.html&#34;&gt;Optional&lt;/a&gt;, which initially seemed like
rather a lot, but it turns out that &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; can do rather more than I originally thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meetup session, we talked about:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/java8-optional-2175753.html&#34;&gt;Optional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: we were pretty
comfortable,
I think, with using &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; to
prevent a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. What we weren&amp;rsquo;t so clear on were the examples of
&lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; - if you were getting your &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; values from a stream, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you do the map and the
filter on the stream first? For example, why do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .findFirst()
    .map(String::trim)
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you could map and filter in the stream to get the first non-empty value? That certainly seems like an
interesting question in relation to streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; being more useful when other APIs fully
support Java 8 and return &lt;code&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; values, then you can perform additional operations on return values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That terminal operation&amp;rsquo;s not actually terminal??&lt;/strong&gt;: We ran into this a couple of times in our examples in the
session, one example is the code above (let&amp;rsquo;s copy it down here so we can look at it more closely):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .findFirst()
    .map(String::trim)
    .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;code&gt;findFirst()&lt;/code&gt; a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html#StreamOps&#34;&gt;terminal operation&lt;/a&gt;? How
can you carry on doing more operations on that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is, of course, that the return type of the terminal operation can also lead to further operations.  The
above is actually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Optional&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; result = list.stream()
                              .findFirst();
result.map(String::trim)
      .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
      .ifPresent(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our terminal operation returns an optional, which allows you to do further operations. Another example of this
confusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .collect(toList())
    .forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;collect()&lt;/code&gt; is a terminal operation, but it returns a list, which also allows &lt;code&gt;forEach()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; results = list.stream()
                           .map(String::toLowerCase)
                           .collect(toList());
results.forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be aware that just because it&amp;rsquo;s called a terminal operation, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t perform other operations on
the returned value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel/sequential/parallel&lt;/strong&gt;: there had been a question in the previous week about why you could write code like
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .parallel()
    .map(String::trim)
    .sequential()
    .filter(s1 -&amp;gt; s1.length() &amp;gt; 0)
    .parallel()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and whether that would let you dictate which sections of the stream were parallel and which were to be processed in
serial.  Lesson two set the lesson straight, declaring &amp;ldquo;the last operator wins&amp;rdquo; - meaning &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the above code will
be run as a parallel stream. I can&amp;rsquo;t find any documentation for this, I&amp;rsquo;ll edit this post if I locate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#unordered--&#34;&gt;Unordered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Why
would you ever want your stream to be unordered?&amp;rdquo; - the answer is that &lt;code&gt;unordered()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/21350234/653519&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t turn
your sorted collection into one with no order&lt;/a&gt;, it just says that when
this code is executed, the order of elements doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  This might make processing faster on a parallel stream,
but as a group we figured it would probably be pointless on a sequential stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency optimisations and order of stream operations&lt;/strong&gt;: We had a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; conversation about the order in which you
perform
operations in a stream. The MOOC (in fact, most documentation around Streams) tells us that a) streams are
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;lazy&lt;/a&gt;, and
not evaluated until a terminal operator is encountered and b) this enables optimisation of the operations in the
stream.  That lead to a discussion about the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() % 2 == 1)
    .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filter operation should result in less items to process in the stream. Given that the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; operation doesn&amp;rsquo;t
change anything that &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; relies on, will this code be optimised somehow under the covers so that the filter
is actually executed first? Or are optimisations still going to respect the order of operations on a stream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our case is actually a very specific case, because a) the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; returns the same type as the params passed in (i.e.
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t map a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;) and b) the &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the characteristic the &lt;code&gt;filter()&lt;/code&gt; is
looking at (i.e. length). But generally speaking, you can&amp;rsquo;t expect these conditions to be true - in fact I bet in a
large number of cases they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true. So pipeline operations are &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22056258/653519&#34;&gt;performed in the order in which they are
written&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that our &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; will not be re-ordered into
a more efficient order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb seems to be to do filtering as early in the stream as possible - that way you can potentially
cut down the number of items you process in each step of the stream. Therefore our code would probably be better as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;list.stream()
    .filter(s -&amp;gt; s.length() % 2 == 1)
    .map(String::toLowerCase)
    .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
**Flat Map**: what...? 
[`flatMap()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#flatMap-java.util.function.Function-) 
is one of those methods that makes total sense once you get the hang of it, and you don&#39;t 
understand why it was so confusing. But the first time you encounter it, it&#39;s confusing - how is `flatMap()` 
different to `map()`?
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt; is used to squish (for example) a stream of streams into just a simple stream. It&amp;rsquo;s like turning a
2-dimensional array into a single dimension so that you can iterate over all the items without needing nested
for-loops. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/22384132/653519&#34;&gt;an example on StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;, and some more examples
in answer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26684562/java-8-map-and-flatmap-methods&#34;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparators&lt;/strong&gt;: We&amp;rsquo;ve probably all written comparators at some point, it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of those examples where we
really did use anonymous inner classes &amp;ldquo;in the olden days&amp;rdquo; and were looking forward to replacing them with lambdas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted(new Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;() {
          @Override
          public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
              return ???;
          }
      })
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, using a lambda still doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question &amp;ldquo;do I minus o1 from o2, or o2 from o1?&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted((o1, o2) -&amp;gt; ??? )
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s yet another new method in Java 8 here that can save us, one that is not nearly as well publicised as it
should be. There&amp;rsquo;s a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#comparing-java.util.function.Function-&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Comparator.comparing()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that you can use to really easily define what to compare on. The JavaDoc and signature looks kinda confusing, but
this is one of those places where method references suddenly make loads of sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reader.lines()
      .sorted(comparingInt(String::length))
      .collect(toList());
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Here we&amp;rsquo;re actually using the &lt;code&gt;comparingInt&lt;/code&gt; method as we&amp;rsquo;re going to compare on a primitive value). Personally this
is one of my favourite new features in Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post for the JetBrains Upsource blog about some of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2015/07/23/what-to-look-for-in-a-code-review/&#34;&gt;things you should be looking for when you do code
reviews&lt;/a&gt; (and some of the things
you should not be looking at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to get feedback in the comments for the post of things that you look for in code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bryant and I did a keynote at Devoxx UK about how individuals can add something to a team to make the team
more productive, and overall more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rock stars are dead. Ninjas are banished. There are simply too many trashed hotel rooms, dead bodies and failed
projects. The age of the individual superhero coder is over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But if we’re still striving for excellence, what’s replaced the rock-star-ninja-hero programmer?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team. The team that’s greater than the sum of its parts. Like The Avengers, but with less latex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the same way those without super powers, genius levels of intelligence and pots of money were vital to The
Avengers, every developer, no matter how much or how little experience they have, brings something important to the
team and has the potential to make it better: a nicer place to work, an openness to learning, a focus on clean code or a deeper understanding of the business’ needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can a collection of good developers become a super-performing business-impact-delivering team? What do you, as
an individual, add to the mix?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daniel and Trisha will share stories of individuals and teams who have made an impact (both good and bad!) and offer
suggestions for steps we, as individuals, can take to level up our teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Java 8 MOOC - Session 1 Summary</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_8_mooc_session1/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; is working together towards completing the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:145:0::::P145_EVENT_ID,P145_PREV_PAGE:4887,143&#34;&gt;Java 8 MOOC&lt;/a&gt; on
lambdas and streams. As part of this, we&amp;rsquo;re running &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/events/223677436/&#34;&gt;three sessions&lt;/a&gt;
during the course so we can, as a group, ask  questions about the lectures, get help with the homework, and (if we&amp;rsquo;re
feeling very smart!) help people who may be struggling (or might not have watched the videos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night we had the first session which went really well. We had a small-ish group, about half of whom had
completed the homework and the quiz (for the first lesson) and half had not. We worked through the homework exercises
together, saw how there were multiple solutions for each problem, and explored how to balance conciseness with
longer, more descriptive code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;First offline session for lesson 1 of the lambdas and streams mooc &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/java8?src=hash&#34;&gt;#java8&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/40gradosAlaSombra?src=hash&#34;&gt;#40gradosAlaSombra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://t.co/hJgPrLl3C5&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJgPrLl3C5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; SVQ JUG (@SVQJUG) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SVQJUG/status/623199430158778368&#34;&gt;July 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole people thought the videos for the course were very clear and well-explained, although we also went
through how to run the videos at 1.5 speed, as most people wanted to run through them faster! I thought the pace of the
videos was especially good for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t so comfortable with listening in English, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to add
subtitles and speed it up if you feel comfortable with the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lesson covers lambdas, and their use in some of the new Java 8 methods (specifically on collections, but
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; streams).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The areas we discussed most, the ones that needed more clarity were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html&#34;&gt;Functional Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;:
what does &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-functional-1&#34;&gt;Single Abstract Method (SAM)&lt;/a&gt; really mean? Also, we
were interested in the &amp;ldquo;exception&amp;rdquo; of methods declared on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; as well as an interface (e.g. &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt;), but we
came
to the conclusion that it was easier to simply think of looking for only one method without any form of
implementation at all - methods defined on &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; must have an implementation, since &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; is not an
abstract class or interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html&#34;&gt;Method References&lt;/a&gt;: we looked at
examples of the three types that aren&amp;rsquo;t constructor references, what they look like in lambda form and how they
differ. Method references are&amp;hellip; not difficult to understand, but do look a bit awkward in the code if you&amp;rsquo;re not
used to them, and can be confusing as all your types, parameters and return values disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallel execution: The first lesson talks a lot about how lambdas are here to make parallelisation and
concurrency easier for developers, so obviously there was a question about how the code in the homework examples would
be executed in a multi-CPU environment. I assumed (although I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for clarification) that methods like
&lt;code&gt;removeIf&lt;/code&gt; are not parallelised, since in the case of Streams you have to explicitly state you want to go parallel.
We also talked a bit about
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html#parallel--&#34;&gt;parallel()&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#parallelStream--&#34;&gt;parallelStream()&lt;/a&gt;, even
though the lesson didn&amp;rsquo;t cover Streams at all. We wanted to understand a bit more about the pros and cons of going
parallel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I also snuck in some demos of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; awesomeness, including
its magical support for creating lambdas and turning things into (and from) method references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great, collaborative session, with most people getting a chance to demonstrate their code (if they wanted
to!). And at the end we had solutions to the five exercise problems and had discussed all the areas people wanted
more clarity on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at QCon New York (probably my business conference this year!) I was
interviewed by Ralph Winzinger for InfoQ. It felt like a short interview at the time,
but we covered a lot of ground - Java 8, Java vs other JVM languages, the effectiveness
of the JCP, and the future of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video and the transcript are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-java-eco-system&#34;&gt;available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I get asked a lot about how I got into technical advocacy /
evangelism&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,
so it seems like the most cost-effective way to answer this question is to
write a post about it. Warning: it&amp;rsquo;s a long one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me caveat this (I always have caveats, don&amp;rsquo;t I?) with, &amp;ldquo;this is
my personal experience&amp;rdquo;.  There may be other ways to get into this role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any long-time readers of the blog (I love you guys!!) will
know that I started blogging before I did any of this
running-around-the-world-speaking-at-conferences lark.  I started blogging
for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even &amp;ldquo;back then&amp;rdquo; (probably around 2007), it was definitely an advantage to
have something external to the day job to differentiate you from other job
candidates.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable with open source, Stack Overflow
wasn&amp;rsquo;t invented yet (and even if it had been, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would have felt
knowledgeable enough to answer questions), and most of what I had learnt in
order to level-up my skills
was via blogs like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/&#34;&gt;Rands in Repose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed writing. One of the (many) things I had wanted to be
&amp;ldquo;when I grew up&amp;rdquo; was a writer or a journalist. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take that path
because I thought if I did I would be Poor Forever.  However, if I started
practising my writing in a blog, I would learn to find my voice, and have
something to show book publishers if I ever did get around to writing a
book, like I had always wanted to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  you&amp;rsquo;ve ever started a blog, you know the problem is thinking of things to
write about. I generally documented things I&amp;rsquo;d had difficulty getting
working, because a) if I had trouble with the existing documentation, other
people would too and b) I have a memory like a goldfish, so it would be
useful for me if nothing else. But it took me years to really take the blog
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2008, I joined the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, largely
because I had returned to London from a year working in New York, and a) I needed a new job (during
the height of the crisis, when my recent experience was all financial
markets!) and b) although I had friends in London, I needed to rebuild my
social networks, and I was using meetup.com to do this. I tried lots of other
meetup groups, but like many geeks, I found it hard to connect to people
without the common ground of tech or code to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I ended up working for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and
because we were always looking
for keen, bright developers, I started getting much more involved in the LJC
so that I could help us hire people I actually wanted to work with. During
this time, people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jr0cket&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;
and, of course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bcrecworks&#34;&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt; were
encouraging me, consciously or not, to do a bit of technical presenting. I saw
a lot of different talks there, some from professional evangelists from
vendors, but many from &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; developers like me. It made me think that
a) I should do this (awesome for your profile/career etc) and b) I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I saw very few women presenting (I do remember an
awesome presentation from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fabianenardon&#34;&gt;Fabiane&lt;/a&gt;) and
also very few women members. Many members
assumed I was a recruiter, even before I started trying to chat to people
to, well, recruit them for LMAX. In the first 2 minutes of meeting someone,
if they didn&amp;rsquo;t ask me directly if I was in recruitment or HR, I would always
make it clear that I was a Java developer. It was tedious but something I
just got used to. Interestingly, once it was clear I was a Java person,
people seemed to accept that and just treat me like any other techie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the reasons I decided to start doing presentations - I
could a) show my own technical credentials, so I would spend less time having
these tiresome conversations (which, by the way, seems to have worked) and
b) make it more normal to see women techies, hopefully minimising the number
times other women faced the same assumptions (I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this worked or
not, as I only have my own experiences to look at).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these thoughts were only floating around my mind, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually
&lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything.  During this time, while working at LMAX, it seemed like there were lots of
things I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; blog about, or talk about, but I never really got round to it.
Plus, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what I was allowed to talk about and what I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
talking about. So apparently during these two years I only wrote a total of 6
posts, and I never did a single presentation at the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I really wanted to do presenting and have time/inspiration for the
blog, so I chose to leave LMAX and join
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; - they were looking for
consultants and I knew this was a company that valued blogging and
presenting, and I&amp;rsquo;d had some exposure to their guys through the LJC and,
years before, I&amp;rsquo;d seen them speaking at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-london.html&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;,
which had actually been my initial inspiration for blogging.
I told LMAX that was why I was leaving, and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s 2011, and I&amp;rsquo;ve joined ThoughtWorks. I revived the blog while I was
unassigned to a project, I invested that time in porting the blog to a
more sensible platform, and trying to write a blog a day. Again, I picked
topics I could comfortably talk about - I spoke about my experiences as a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_experiences_with_android_development/&#34;&gt;beginner trying Android for the first
time&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes people will be arsey
with beginners, but in reality many real human beings can&amp;rsquo;t tell you you&amp;rsquo;re
wrong when you&amp;rsquo;re just talking about your own experiences), and despite my
original intent to blog with zero gender identity (I was genuinely afraid
that if I wrote about tech subjects and I was wrong, or very junior, I would
give women programmers a bad name) I decided to blog about &amp;ldquo;the women in
technology subject&amp;rdquo;. Again, here I went for my personal opinion/experiences,
for which only mean people can criticise you (mean people are easier to
ignore than correct people :) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also fortunate enough to meet &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;
in person while he was over
in London. We were talking over drinks (this is London, after all) about the
women in technology thing (ThoughtWorks are really big on this subject, and
determined to do something positive in this area), and I was complaining about
the lack of women at a particular conference. He asked me if I had submitted
a talk for the conference.  Me?? Of course not! I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for that! I&amp;rsquo;ve
got nothing to talk about. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been given permission to do this, or
guidance on how to do it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t even presented at the user group yet. But
it did make me think - I said I wanted to present, so what was stopping me?
Did I need someone to guide me through it, to assign it to me as a task? It
was going to be up to me to make this happen. And if Martin Fowler, who
had just met me 5 minutes beforehand, thinks I&amp;rsquo;m ready to do this, then who&amp;rsquo;s
to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m not? What&amp;rsquo;s the worst that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course life then got in the way - I was assigned to a couple of projects,
so the blogging stopped. I was interested in attending or
speaking at conferences, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to have anything ThoughtWorksy to
talk about for quite a while. And now, because I was commuting to my assigned
project, I had very little time even for the LJC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, LMAX called
to let me know that the talk they&amp;rsquo;d done at QCon San Francisco,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Do 100K TPS at Less than 1ms Latency&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; had been
enormously popular, and they were open sourcing
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to do
some evangelism around this - did I want to come back and help a) do
evangelism and b) co-ordinate the company&amp;rsquo;s evangelism?  Yes, yes I did. So,
after just 3 months, I quit TW and went back to LMAX&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at LMAX, I started to take evangelism more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to blog every week - I set aside Sundays for blogging (at the time
I was, fortunately for my particular choices, single and not overburdened
with a social life outside of the LJC). I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to sit all alone in my
tiny flat, so I&amp;rsquo;d go to the pub with my shiny new Macbook Air, bought
specially for blogging (thanks ThoughtWorks, you spoiled me - I needed a mac
after I&amp;rsquo;d invested 3 months getting to grips with the one you gave me) and
write &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t always amazing, but I&amp;rsquo;d do something. During the
week, when ideas came to me, I&amp;rsquo;d make a note of the title in the blogging
tool so that when Sunday came I&amp;rsquo;d pick one and go with it.  Early on it was
fairly easy - we&amp;rsquo;d released a white paper on the Disruptor, but I found it
hard to understand what it really meant, so I spent Sundays writing shorter
articles breaking down how it worked and how to use it. I needed a LOT of
help from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.real-logic.co.uk/about.html&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mikeb2701&#34;&gt;Mike
Barker&lt;/a&gt; to understand it, but they were patient
with me (plus I think they were happy that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; was writing this and it
didn&amp;rsquo;t
have to be them). They took the heavier, more complicated subjects and I
pitched my stuff at developers like myself. When I ran out of Disruptor
stuff, I moved on to the topics I had in the backlog - I generally had more
ideas for blogs than time to blog, so I ended up with quite a long list to
pick from. The key is to make a note of it at the time you think of it, and
not try and think of a topic when you sit down with time to blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I coordinated our events and publicised them on the new LMAX blog I&amp;rsquo;d created.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/davefarley77&#34;&gt;Dave Farley&lt;/a&gt; was often presenting on
something Continuous Delivery related since
&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1NyUQ53&#34;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt; had been released, and Martin was talking
about hardcore concurrency stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike and I got even more involved in the LJC, not just to recruit people.  We
got involved in the JCP and OpenJDK - since LMAX was doing cutting edge
technology stuff with Java, we wanted to see where the language was going
and influence it too if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martijn must&amp;rsquo;ve got fed up my lack of drive in the presenting area, as he
pretty much forced me to do my first presentation.  In a
nice way! But he told me I was ready, he checked my content before I did it,
and I did a short talk on the JCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, my plan was to spend this first year of presenting doing short
talks at the JUG, maybe work my way up to a longer talk by the end of the year, or maybe
the following year, then the year after that to submit to conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, with amazing mentors like mine, that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Martin Thompson was
due to
give a talk at JavaOne at the end of that year (still 2011), and I was lucky
enough to get a ticket at the last minute (we won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.net/dukeschoice/2011&#34;&gt;Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award
for Innovative Programming Framework&lt;/a&gt;,
and LMAX was awesome enough to let me have the ticket to the
conference to receive the award, since the evangelism efforts and blogging
had had a direct influence on us winning this award). Martin
asked if I wanted to co-present with him. Of course this was terrifying! I
hadn&amp;rsquo;t even done a full length talk at the LJC, I had barely even been to a
conference, let alone presented at the largest Java conference In The World!
So I said yes. These opportunities do not come up every week. It&amp;rsquo;s a talk
Martin had given various times before, he would be there to pick up the slack
if I freaked out, and I knew this material, I&amp;rsquo;d been blogging about it and
answering questions for the last 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really was as terrifying as I thought.  But.  It went well. I answered
difficult questions. We got great feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011_roundup/&#34;&gt;JavaOne 2011&lt;/a&gt;
was an important milestone in my evangelism career.  Not only
did I get to put this presentation on my CV, I got to meet a lot of people in
this network: Martin introduced me to a lot of high performance specialists;
Martijn and Ben introduced me to people involved in the JCP, to other Java
User Group leaders, and we somehow got in to the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly party -
I finally got to meet a book publisher and get one step closer to my dream
of writing a book. I also met the ladies behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt;,
and they introduced me to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Stephan007&#34;&gt;Stephan&lt;/a&gt; who runs Devoxx. This turned out
to be an important step in turning an idea I had for a panel into a Devoxx
reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is October.  By the end of the year I had also presented at &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/&#34;&gt;JAX London
with Mike&lt;/a&gt;, and at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_we_shouldnt_target_women/&#34;&gt;Devoxx Belgium on a panel&lt;/a&gt;,
largely thanks to the contacts I
had made and the prestige of having a JavaOne talk under my belt.  So I went
from basically zero at the start of that year (my blog had been dormant for
years and I had no experience presenting) to having a blog with thousands of
hits a month and being an &amp;ldquo;international conference speaker&amp;rdquo;. In many ways I
got lucky, because the Disruptor was a really interesting, technical topic
that is in an area developers feel they should understand (high performance).
But I believe it was more a) determination to make this work, even if it
meant using my own time to write blogs and prepare presentations and b)
fantastic mentors who pushed me to do it and opened up their networks to me,
that facilitated this rapid rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, after that things were a lot easier - I had the experience
presenting at conferences, I had Martin and Martijn suggesting conferences to
me (and introducing me to the right people where appropriate), which got me
into the QCon/GOTO loop and into OSCON. With videos of my presentations
availble, combined with the reach of my blog, I also had people approaching
me to do other events, like user groups in the cities I was visiting, and
conferences I had never heard of.  I think it helped that I&amp;rsquo;m a woman,
because conferences are always actively looking to increase their diversity
(whatever it might seem like at times!), but I think that anyone could follow
these sorts of steps with a similar outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk much about my career after that, because really that&amp;rsquo;s
the tipping point - after that it was more of the same, really. I will say
that I left LMAX because the pressure to be a full time developer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; do
advocacy is hard, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re no longer single and you don&amp;rsquo;t have
the spare time you used to have. I joined
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; because they were well known for
understanding the technical community, and because they were looking for an
evangelist who would continue to be an engineer (although not for 40 hours a
week every week). I think they might have hired me without the previous
experience, but the blogging and presenting experience was a big selling
point for the guy who became my boss.  I eventually left
them for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; because you learn, over
time, what your sweet spots are as an advocate/educator, and what your
interests are. After two years of MongoDB, I knew I really wanted to focus
on Java and the JVM, and JetBrains is a much better fit for that. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty
certain I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have got this job without a) having the
conference-presenting experience and therefore b) being known to the team
already through the conference circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. That was a massive post. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off
writing this for ages. That&amp;rsquo;s just my own story, I have another post in my
head about the challenges that face you on trying to sell the value of
evangelism/advocacy to your organisation (and maybe some suggestions). But
that&amp;rsquo;s for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I shall try to leave you with take-away points that I hope will
be helpful if you either want to become a technical advocate, or are interested
in just some aspects, like writing or presenting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join a user group.  I cannot, &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; stress how important the LJC was to
my career. If you do nothing else, this is the one thing that can help you.
You will meet people who will inspire you or give you the kick up the
backside you need. Try to remember that many of these people, like me, were
developers like you before they became bloggers/authors/speakers. If they
can, you can. These people also have networks, and whether you like it or
not, it really is not what you know but who you know (but don&amp;rsquo;t let that put
you off - meeting the right people can be easier than becoming some sort of
super-expert!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Present at the user group. Preferably get them to video it - you can use
this in submissions to conferences, if it&amp;rsquo;s not a blind CFP they will like to
see examples of your style. Having an example, even one that you think isn&amp;rsquo;t
awesome, is much, much better than having nothing at all. (Also, and this is
not a blog post about becoming a better speaker, but do watch your own
videos - it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;insanely&lt;/em&gt; painful the first few times, but it gets easier and
will help you to improve).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to commit your own time to this. I blogged and prepared talks
at weekends, even for companies that valued evangelism. I gave up evenings
to attend the user group.  This will be
especially important in the early days when you probably have a day job too.
This investment should pay off, either your company will learn to see the
value of it and give you more time (having developers attend and speak at the
LJC was enormously successful for recruitment for LMAX), or you will get a
job better suited to what you want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have something awesome to talk about. I got lucky with
the Disruptor, true. But our most in-demand topics at the Sevilla Java User
Group are &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; topics, especially for things that are
no-longer cutting edge - not all developers were early adopters, and now they
need an overview of &amp;ldquo;why NoSQL&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s Docker&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be awesome. Your blog doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be perfect English
(especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not a native). It just needs to clearly describe the
thing you&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain. You don&amp;rsquo;t
have to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/author/Damian-Conway&#34;&gt;Damian Conway&lt;/a&gt;(one of
my favourite presenters) when you speak - in my experience, a presenter
can get away with either &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great content or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; great delivery, you
actually don&amp;rsquo;t need both. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to conferences where presenters haven&amp;rsquo;t
really had either - you have to start somewhere, and audiences are
surprisingly forgiving (especially at user groups).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find mentors. Listen to them. You might not even meet them, you can watch
what they do. But I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to find real human beings who are a step
or two closer to where you want to be. Talk to them, let them know what you
want. And let them bully you into doing scary things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be yourself. Figure out your strengths and interests, and play to them. I
was scared of being a woman developer on show, via the blog or via
conferences, but it turns out to be an advantage. I was afraid that because
I&amp;rsquo;m not Martin Thompson I can&amp;rsquo;t possibly talk about difficult technical
subjects. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be him, I can be me - I can explain things to
the level that I need to understand them, so other developers like me can
catch up with me. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to all be genius-level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do things that scare you. The terrifying things are the things that got me
the furthest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Evangelism / Technical Advocacy - I use these terms fairly
interchangeably. Evangelism was the common name some years back, but many
are uncomfortable with the religious overtones, so instead prefer Advocacy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This is why I often talk about being at ThoughtWorks for a
minute and a half - I really loved a lot of things about the company, but what
I really wanted to do was offered to me in a company I already knew, where I
could get going straight away without any ramp up&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation is about how to change a team&amp;rsquo;s attitude towards writing automated tests.  The
talk covers the same case study as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/groovy_vs_java&#34;&gt;Groovy vs Java for Testing&lt;/a&gt;, adopting
Spock in MongoDB, but this is a more process/agile/people perspective, not a
technical look at the merits of one language over another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sadly do not have a lot of time for questions during the presentation, but
thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I have a list of unanswered
questions which I will attempt to address here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is testing to find out your system works? Or is it so you know when your
system is broken?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excellent question. I would expect that if you have a system that&amp;rsquo;s in
production (which is probably the large majority of the projects we work on),
we can assume the system is working, for some definition of working.
Automated testing is particularly good at catching when your system stops
doing the things you thought it was doing when you wrote the tests (which
may, or may not, mean the system is genuinely &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo;). Regression testing is
to find out when your system is no longer doing what you expect, and automated tests are
really good for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But testing can also make sure you implement code that behaves the way you
expect, especially if you write the tests first.  Automated tests can be used
to determine that your code is complete, according to some pre-agreed
specification (in this case, the automated tests you wrote up front).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is, when you first write the tests you
have tests that, when they pass, proves the system works (&lt;em&gt;assuming&lt;/em&gt; your
tests are testing the right things and/or not giving you false positives).
Subsequent passes show that you haven&amp;rsquo;t broken anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what level do &amp;ldquo;tests documenting code&amp;rdquo; actually become useful? And who
is/should the documentation be targeted to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the presentation, my case study is the MongoDB Java Driver.  Our users
were Java programmers, who were going to be coding using our driver.  So in
this example, it makes a lot of sense to document the code using a language
that our users understood.  We started with Java, and ended up using Groovy
because it was also understandable for our users and a bit more succinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a previous project we had different types of tests.  The unit and system
tests documented what the expected behaviour was at the class or module
level, and was aimed at developers in the team.  The acceptance tests were
written in Java, but in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.symphonious.net/2015/06/05/testinglmax-abstraction-by-dsl/&#34;&gt;friendly DSL-style way&lt;/a&gt;. These were usually
written by a triad of tester, business analyst and developer, and documented to all
these guys and girls what the top-level behaviour should be. Our audience here
was fairly technical though, so there was no need to go to the extent of trying
to write English-language-style tests, they were readable enough for a
reasonably techy (but non-programmer) audience. These were not designed to be
read by &amp;ldquo;the business&amp;rdquo; - us developers might use
them to answer questions about the behaviour of the system, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t
document it in a way that just anyone could understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are two different approaches for two different-sized
team/organisations, with different users. So I guess in summary the answer is
&amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.  But at the very least, developers on your own team should be
able to read your tests and understand what the expected behaviour of the
code is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you become a team champion? I.e. get authority and acceptance that
people listen to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In my case, it was just by accident - I happened to care about the tests
being green and also being useful, so I moaned at people until it happened. But
it&amp;rsquo;s not just about nagging, you get more buy-in if other people see you
doing the right things the right way, and it&amp;rsquo;s not too painful for them to
follow your example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are going to be things that you care about that you&amp;rsquo;ll never get other
people to care about, and this will be different from team to team. You have
two choices here - if you care that much, and it bothers you that much, you
have to do it yourself (often on your own time, especially if your boss
doesn&amp;rsquo;t buy into it). Or, you have to let it go - when it comes to quality,
there are so many things you could care about that it might be more
beneficial to drop one cause and pick another that you can get people to care
about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I wanted us to use &lt;code&gt;assertThat&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;assertFalse&lt;/code&gt; (or
true, or equals, or whatever).  I tried to demo the advantages (as I saw
them) of my approach to the team, and tried to push this in code reviews, but
in the end the other developers weren&amp;rsquo;t sold on the benefits, and
from my point of view the benefits weren&amp;rsquo;t big enough to force the issue.
Those of us who cared, used &lt;code&gt;assertThat&lt;/code&gt;. For the rest, I was just happy
people were writing and maintaining tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, pick your battles. You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at how many people do get on board
with things.  I thought implementing checkstyle and setting draconian
formatting standards was going to be a tough battle, but in the end people
were just happy to have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; standards, especially when they were enforced
by the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you report test, style, coverage, etc failures separately? Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We didn&amp;rsquo;t fail on coverage.  Enforcing a coverage percentage is a really good
way to end up with crappy tests, like for getters/setters and constructors
(by the way, if there&amp;rsquo;s enough logic in your constructor that it &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a
test, You&amp;rsquo;re Doing It Wrong).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally different types of failures are found by different tools, so for
this reason alone they will be reported separately - for example, checkstyle
will fail the build if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to our style standards, codenarc
fails it for Groovy style failures, and Gradle will run the tests in a
different task to these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s actually important, though, is time-to-failure.  For checkstyle, for
example, it will fail on something silly like curly braces in the wrong place.
You want this to fail within seconds, so you can fix the silly mistake
quickly. Ideally you&amp;rsquo;d have IntelliJ (perhaps) run your checks before it even
makes it into your CI environment. Compiler errors should, of course, fail
things before you run a test, short-running tests should fail before
long-running tests.  Basically, the easier it is to fix the problem, the
sooner you want to know, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our build was relatively small and not too complex, so actually we ran all
our types of tests (integration and unit, both Groovy and Java) in a single
task, because this turned out to be much quicker in Gradle (in our case) than
splitting things up into a simple pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have a reason to report stuff separately, but for me it&amp;rsquo;s much more
important to understand how fast I need to be aware of a particular type of
failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes I find myself modifying code design and architecture to enable
testing. How can I avoid damaging design?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a great question, and a common one too. The short answer is: &lt;em&gt;in
general&lt;/em&gt; writing code that&amp;rsquo;s easier to test leads to a cleaner design anyway
(for example, dependency injection at that appropriate places). If you find
you need to rip your design apart to test it, there&amp;rsquo;s a smell there somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;either your design isn&amp;rsquo;t following SOLID principals, or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to
test the wrong things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the common example here is testing private methods - how do you test
these without exposing secrets&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;? I think for me, if it&amp;rsquo;s important
enough
to be tested
it&amp;rsquo;s important enough to be exposed in some way - it might belong in some
sort of util or helper (right now I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into whether utils or
helpers are, in themselves a smell), in a smaller class that only
provides this sort of functionality, or simply a protected method. Or, if
you&amp;rsquo;re testing with Groovy, you can access private methods anyway so this
becomes a moot point (i.e. your testing framework may be limiting you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another story from LMAX, we found we had created methods just for testing. It seemed a
bit wrong to have these methods only available for testing, but later on down
the line, we needed access to many of these methods In Real Life (well, from
our Admin app), so our testing had &amp;ldquo;found&amp;rdquo; a missing feature. When we came
to implement it, it was pretty easy as we&amp;rsquo;d already done most of it for
testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My co-workers often point to a lack of end-to-end testing as the reason why
a lot of bugs get out to production even though they don&amp;rsquo;t have much unit
tests nor integration tests. What, in your experience, is a good balance
between unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end testing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hmm, sounds to me like &amp;ldquo;lack of tests&amp;rdquo; is your problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big (and contentious!) topic.  [Martin Fowler has written about it]
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html),&#34;&gt;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html),&lt;/a&gt; Google wrote something I
completely disagree with (so I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to link to it,
but you&amp;rsquo;ll find references in the links in this paragraph), and my
ex-colleague Adrian [talks about what we, at LMAX, meant by end-to-end tests]
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.symphonious.net/2015/04/30/making-end-to-end-tests-work/)&#34;&gt;https://www.symphonious.net/2015/04/30/making-end-to-end-tests-work/)&lt;/a&gt;. I
hope that&amp;rsquo;s enough to get you started, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty more out there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you go about getting buy in from the team to use Spock?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I cover this in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/groovy_vs_java&#34;&gt;my other presentation on the topic&lt;/a&gt; - the
short version is, I did a week-long spike to investigate whether Spock would
make testing easier for us, showed the pros and cons to the whole team, and
then led by example writing tests that (I thought) were more readable than
what we had before and, probably most importantly, much easier to write than
what we were previously doing. I basically got buy-in by showing how much
easier it was for us to use the tool than even JUnit (which we were all
familiar with). It did help that we were already using Gradle, so we already
had a development dependency on Groovy. It also helped that adding Spock made
no changes to the dependencies of the final Jar, which was very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, further buy-in (certainly from management) came when the new tests
started catching more errors - usually regressions in our code or regressions in
the server&amp;rsquo;s overnight builds. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was Spock specifically
that caught more problems - I think it was writing more tests, and
better tests, that caught the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we do data driven style tests in frameworks like junit or cucumber?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can in JUnit (although maybe there&amp;rsquo;s something out there). I
believe someone told me you can do it in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://testng.org/doc/index.html&#34;&gt;TestNG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there drawbacks to having tests that only run in ci? I.e I have Java 8
on my machine, but the test requires Java 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, definitely - the drawback is Time.  You have to commit your code to a
branch that is being checked by CI and wait for CI to finish before you find
the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, we found very little that was different between Java
7 and 8, for example, but this is a valid concern (otherwise you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
testing a complex matrix of dependencies at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, our Java 6 driver used Netty for async capabilities, as the
stuff we were using from Java 7 wasn&amp;rsquo;t available. This was clearly a
different code path that wasn&amp;rsquo;t tested by us locally as we were all running
Java 8. Probably more importantly for us is we were testing against at least
3 different major versions of the server, which all supported different
features (and had different APIs).  I would often find I&amp;rsquo;d broken the tests
for version 2.2 as I&amp;rsquo;d only been running it on 2.6, and had forgotten to
either turn off the new tests for the old server versions, or didn&amp;rsquo;t realise
the new functionality wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the main drawback is time - it takes a lot longer to find out about these
errors.  There are a few ways to get around this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit often!! And to a branch that&amp;rsquo;s actually going to be run by CI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your build as fast as possible, so you get failures fast (you
should be doing this anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could set up virtual machines locally or somewhere cloudy to run these
configurations before committing, but that sounds kinda painful (and to my
mind defeats a lot of the point of CI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I set up Travis on my fork of the project, so I could have that running a
different version of Java and MongoDB when I committed to my own fork - I&amp;rsquo;d
be able to see some errors before they made it into the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can, you probably want these specific tests run first so they can
fail fast. E.g. if you&amp;rsquo;re running a Java 6 &amp;amp; MongoDB 2.2 configuration on
CI, run those tests that only work in that environment first.  Would
probably need some Gradle magic, and/or might need you to separate these
into a different set of folders.  The advantage of this approach though is
if you set up some aliases on your local machine you could sanity check
&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; these special cases before checking in. For example, I had aliases to
start MongoDB versions/configurations from a single command, and to set
JAVA_HOME to whichever version I wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any tips for unit tests that pass on dev machines but not on
Jenkins because it&amp;rsquo;s not as powerful as our own machines? E.g. Synchronous
calls timeout on the Jenkins builds intermittently.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Erk! Yes, not uncommon. No, not really. We had our timeouts set longer than I
would have liked to prevent these sorts of errors, and they still
intermittently failed. You can also set some sort of retry on the test, and
get your build system to re-run those that fail to see if they pass later.
It&amp;rsquo;s kinda nasty though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At LMAX they were able to take testing seriously enough to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.symphonious.net/2015/06/24/end-to-end-tests-lmax-update/&#34;&gt;really invest in
their testing
architecture&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, this is The Correct Answer. Just
often very difficult to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you ask where are tests and dev asks if code is correct? And you say yes.
Then dev asks why you&amp;rsquo;re delaying shipping value, how do you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are my opinions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your code is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; complete without tests that show me it&amp;rsquo;s complete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your code might do what you think it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to do right now, but given
Shared Code Ownership, anyone can come in and change it at any time, you
want tests in place to make sure they don&amp;rsquo;t change it to break what you
thought it did&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tests are not so much to show it works right now, the tests are to
show it continues to work in future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having automated tests &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; speed you up in future. You can refactor
more safely, you can fix bugs and know almost immediately if you broke
something, you can read from the test what the author of the code thought
the code should do, getting you up to speed faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t know you&amp;rsquo;re shipping value without tests - you&amp;rsquo;re only shipping
code (to be honest, you never know if you&amp;rsquo;re shipping value until much later
on when you also analyse if people are even using the feature).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing almost never slows you down in the long run. Show me the bits of your
code base which are poorly tested, and I bet I can show you the bits of your
code base that frequently have bugs (either because the code is not really
doing what the author thinks, or because subsequent changes break things in
subtle ways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you say code is hard to understand and dev asks if you seriously don&amp;rsquo;t
understand the code, how do you explain you mean easy to understand without
thinking rather than &amp;lsquo;can I compile this in my head&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have zero problem with saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m too stupid to understand this code, and
I expect you&amp;rsquo;re much smarter than me for writing it. Can you please write it
in a way so that a less smart person like myself won&amp;rsquo;t trample all over your
beautiful code at a later date through lack of understanding?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, code should be easy to understand by someone who&amp;rsquo;s not the
author. If someone who is not the author says the code is hard to understand,
then the code is hard to understand. This is not negotiable. This is what
code reviews or pair programming should address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is effective nagging like? (Whether or not you get what you want)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mmm, good question. Off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t make the people who are the target of the nagging feel stupid -
they&amp;rsquo;ll get defensive. If necessary, take the burden of &amp;ldquo;stupidity&amp;rdquo; on
yourself. E.g. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just not smart enough to be able to tell if this test is
failing because the test is bad or because the code is bad. Can you walk me
through it and help me fix it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; your fair share of the work, if not more. When I wanted to
get the code to a state where we could fail style errors, I fixed 99% of the
problems, and delegated the handful of remaining ones that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t
have the context to fix. In the face of three errors to fix each, the team
could hardly say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; after I&amp;rsquo;d fixed over 6000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; things need to be done. Developers are adults and don&amp;rsquo;t want
to be treated like children. Give them a good reason and they&amp;rsquo;ll follow the
rules. The few times I didn&amp;rsquo;t have good reasons, I could not get the team
to do what I wanted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find carrots and sticks that work.  At LMAX, a short e-mail at the start
of the day summarising the errors that had happened overnight, who seemed to
be responsible, and whether they looked like real errors or
intermittencies, was enough to get people to fix their problems&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -
they didn&amp;rsquo;t like to look bad, but they also had enough information to get right
on it, they didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wade through all the build info.  On occasion,
when people were ignoring this, I&amp;rsquo;d turn up to work with bags of chocolate
that I&amp;rsquo;d bought with my own money, offering chocolate bars to anyone who
fixed up the tests. I was random with my carrot offerings so people didn&amp;rsquo;t
game the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give up if it&amp;rsquo;s not working. If you&amp;rsquo;ve tried to phrase the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; in a
number of ways, if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried to show examples of the benefits, if you&amp;rsquo;ve
tried to work the results you want into a process, but it&amp;rsquo;s still not
getting done, just accept the fact that this isn&amp;rsquo;t working for the team.
Move on to something else, or find a new angle.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I had a colleague at LMAX who was  working with a hypothesis that
All Private Methods Were Evil - they were clearly only sharable within
single class, so provided no reuse elsewhere, and if you have the same bit
of code being called multiple times from within the same class (but it&amp;rsquo;s
not valuable elsewhere) then maybe your design is wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m still
pondering this specific hypothesis 4 years on, and I admit I see its pros
and cons.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This worked so well that this process was automated by
one of the guys and turned into a tool called AutoTrish, which as far as I
know is still used at LMAX.  Dave Farley talks about it in some of his
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/continuous-delivery-part-2-2&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery talks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My talk that specifically looks at the
&lt;a href=&#34;presentation/groovy_vs_java/&#34;&gt;advantages of Spock over JUnit&lt;/a&gt;, plus some
Spock-specific resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Jay Fields book
&lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/wewut&#34;&gt;Working Effectively With Unit Tests&lt;/a&gt; - if I
could have made the whole team read this before moving to Spock, we might
have stuck with JUnit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go read everything Adrian Sutton has written about testing at LMAX. If not
everything, definitely &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.symphonious.net/2015/06/05/testinglmax-abstraction-by-dsl/&#34;&gt;Abstraction by
DSL&lt;/a&gt;
and

&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t make it all the way through Dave Farley and Jez Humble&amp;rsquo;s

Dave&amp;rsquo;s presentations on the subject, for example &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/cd-success&#34;&gt;The Rationale for Continuous
Delivery&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/technology-practice-continuous-delivery&#34;&gt;The Process,
Technology and Practice of Continuous
Delivery&lt;/a&gt; - my own talk was
around testing, but I&amp;rsquo;m working off the assumption that you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;
running some sort of Continuous Integration, if not Continuous Delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin Fowler has loads of &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/tags/testing.html&#34;&gt;interesting and useful articles on
testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What can you do to help developers a) write tests b) write meaningful tests
and c) write readable tests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trisha will talk about her experiences of working in a team that wanted to
build quality into their new software version without a painful overhead -
without a QA / Testing team, without putting in place any formal processes,
without slavishly improving the coverage percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team had been writing automated tests and running them in a continuous
integration environment, but they were simply writing tests as another tick
box to check, there to verify the developer had done what the developer had
aimed to do. The team needed to move to a model where tests provided more
than this. The tests needed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate that the library code was meeting the requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document in a readable fashion what those requirements were, and what should happen under non-happy-path situations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide enough coverage so a developer could confidently refactor the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover how the team selected a new testing framework (Spock, a
framework written in Groovy that can be used to test JVM code) to aid with
this effort, and how they evaluated whether this tool would meet the team’s
needs. And now, two years after starting to use Spock, Trisha can talk
about how both the tool and the shift in the focus of the purpose of tests
has affected the quality of the code. And, interestingly, the happiness
of the developers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked three simple questions about my thoughts on Java turning 20, and ended up writing a

No wonder I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find the time to write these days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6771.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
calm before the storm&#34; title=&#34;The calm before the storm&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them.  I could claim lack of time, but
the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me
think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading
that, but I get bored of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6803.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34; title=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m bored of conferences. On the contrary - since I work from home, travelling to new places and
meeting Real Human Beings keeps me sane. Plus conferences are fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6753.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
setup&#34; title=&#34;The setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I went to a conference on Saturday that makes me feel compelled to write something, and not just because it was
organised by my two fellow &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla JUG&lt;/a&gt; organisers.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt; are both doing more Android day-to-day than
server-side Java, so this is an area they&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about. Not content with organising
Android events every other month, they decided they had so many interesting speakers they wanted to have speaking here
in Sevilla that they wanted to run a whole day, single track conference, on behalf of &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/communities/114997118727600981533&#34;&gt;GDG Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidxtended.com/&#34;&gt;Android Xtended&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6848.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Android Xtended&#34; title=&#34;Android Xtended&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Java &amp;ldquo;Technical Advocate&amp;rdquo;, I suppose I should keep an eye on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the Android space, it&amp;rsquo;s quite a
huge part of the ecosystem&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to go in any sort
of official capacity (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t speaking, manning a booth, organising or sponsoring), so I could just enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/registration.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hola...&#34; title=&#34;Hola...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, they roped me into doing registrations. Me! I was concerned my Spanish wasn&amp;rsquo;t up for it, but apparently I only
needed two words: &amp;ldquo;nombre&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;talla&amp;rdquo; (for the t-shirt). Oh, and &amp;ldquo;treinta y uno b&amp;rdquo; - there was such demand for the
conference the initial venue wasn&amp;rsquo;t big enough, so it was being hosted at two sites on the same road. Not
surprisingly, some turned up to the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6813.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34; title=&#34;@inmaculadaalcon&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a large number of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; events, all the talks were in Spanish. So feel
free to ignore my analysis if you like - my Spanish comprehension is pretty good, but sometimes I don&amp;rsquo;t realise when
I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand something and just make up my own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;float:left; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6794.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;@flipper83&#34; title=&#34;@flipper83&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far in the Android space is Getting Started type material - a lot of tutorials and
examples that show you how to achieve a particular goal. There seems to be less of an emphasis on areas that
interest me as an experienced Java person - easy automation of testing, good design practices, craftsmanship etc. Now,
it may be that because those areas (apart from testing) apply to both back-end Java and Android, there&amp;rsquo;s less of a
need to re-iterate it in the Android space. Or it may be that I don&amp;rsquo;t see the entry-level Java stuff any more,
because I don&amp;rsquo;t need it, and I seek out the topics that interest me.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6892.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
 alt=&#34;@JMPergar&#34; title=&#34;@JMPergar&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it may be that as Android is one of those
platforms that&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start as a fairly novice developer (because you can write self-contained code with
a visible UI and get results fairly easily), lots of the focus is on the needs of new developers.  Whatever the
reason, I had been starting to feel like the Android ecosystem was missing people taking developers beyond that
initial step of getting something to work and up to the level of creating maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6880.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34; title=&#34;@pedro_g_s&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended put my mind at rest. Here was a range of talks that led attendees through the things that will make
them more effective developers - tools and libraries to use; testing approaches; integration with persistence; clean
(code) design for the UI; design patterns and domain driven design to simplify your code, and so on. As an employee
of JetBrains, I was obviously very happy to see both
&lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html&#34;&gt;Android Studio&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; mentioned and used throughout as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6863.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;@davilagrau&#34; title=&#34;@davilagrau&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as fantastic speakers (they knew their stuff, were clearly practitioners, and all had great individual
presentation styles), there were three mob-programming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6853.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mob Programming&#34; title=&#34;Mob Programming&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an ambitious attempt to not just preach to
a passive audience, but to involve them in creating real, working code to teach fundamental practices - dependency
injection, testing and Gradle.  An hour is barely enough time to give a practiced demo of real code, to create
something collaboratively with an audience of 30 people was a challenge. But I thought it did give people a flavour
of not just how to use the technologies, but what they were for. I also saw a lot of the audience starting to
realise the power of refactoring using an IDE - I firmly believe the best way to teach the power of a tool is by
pair programming or, at least, using the tool in real use cases in front of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6921.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;More collaboration&#34; title=&#34;More collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mob programming was kinda
like a half day tutorial squished into an hour. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear how the attendees found it. For me, since
this was a full day conference that cost €10, I thought getting three short tutorials as well as five excellent
talks was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6896.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Happy developers&#34; title=&#34;Happy developers&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6883.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; 
alt=&#34;Interesting...&#34; title=&#34;Interesting...&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss in talking about the conference if I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention the venue.  We were at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt;, which was pretty easy to get to, and a really nice, airy, comfortable
space&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
And they let us rearrange their whole place just for us. The only downside is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold more people, which
is a shame, and the reason we had to host on two sites (I can&amp;rsquo;t comment on the other site as I stayed
at RES the whole day, but we&amp;rsquo;re very grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitnami.com/&#34;&gt;Bitnami&lt;/a&gt; for lending us their offices as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6831.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Collaboration&#34; title=&#34;Collaboration&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did I learn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://espaciores.org/&#34;&gt;Espacio RES&lt;/a&gt; is a really nice space that hopefully we can use more regularly for events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to use Good Practices to write Android code, and Real Developers are doing so for Real Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are very talented and expert technical speakers in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to two conferences in Spain in
the last month, but as they were all in English I think it puts some people off presenting. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to see Spanish
talent being showcased, it gives developers here good role models and shows that experts aren&amp;rsquo;t just from outside
Spain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sevilla has a very healthy tech scene with people more than happy to give up a Saturday to learn new things. In
fact, for some set of people, they prefer Saturdays to weekday
evenings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/androidxtended#footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I have a feeling I&amp;rsquo;m about to lose more weekends in the
future&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6872.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;People like Saturdays?&#34; title=&#34;People like 
 Saturdays?&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android Xtended was a fantastic event, with great speakers and engaged attendees.  I loved how social
everyone was during the breaks, how people were happy to chat and share stories, even though most of the attendees
didn&amp;rsquo;t know each other beforehand. It was brilliantly organised, and although I did see how much work went into
arranging it, you would never believe from how smoothly it went that this two-venue event was organised by just two
guys. Well done &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/DSC_6927.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Drinks&#34; title=&#34;Drinks&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Although in my experience Android and &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; Java user groups and events tend not to
overlap much - not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a function of the relationship between Google and Oracle or just because large cities like
London tend to split groups along technology lines to keep group and event sizes manageable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The downside was there are not a lot of places nearby open for coffee at 8am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;footnote3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This is completely alien to me as someone who built her career largely in London - you
do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; host events on a Saturday, except for maybe the annual LJC Open Conference, because many people have a
long commute into the city. Doing that 5 days a week is plenty, most people don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it on a Saturday as
well. But they will give up a couple of hours in the evening, as it costs far less in time overall.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Blind CFPs - a Postscript</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Since publishing &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great comments, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write yet
another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me state that I don&amp;rsquo;t think blind CFPs are a complete waste of time - for example, I know that there are
circles in which speakers will refuse to submit if the selection process isn&amp;rsquo;t blind. But what blind CFPs are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;,
is an answer to &amp;ldquo;How do I get more women speakers at my conference?&amp;rdquo;, especially if the problem is not that the
women are being rejected, but that they simply aren&amp;rsquo;t submitting talks - this is the situation I see most frequently
in the conferences I speak at/help organise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;youre-missing-the-point-of-blind-cfps&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re missing the point of blind CFPs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to address the point &amp;ldquo;Blind CFPs are to protect the organisers, not simply to improve diversity&amp;rdquo;. OK, great. So
in the case of the conferences that had only two women out of 200 submissions: if you make that process blind, whether you
select both women or not, when there are nasty comments about your lack of women speakers, you&amp;rsquo;re protected - you did
the right things, you had a blind CFP, and just not many women made it through that process. Women simply aren&amp;rsquo;t
writing compelling abstracts and/or aren&amp;rsquo;t picking interesting subjects and/or clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in
presenting at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAAARRRGGHHHHHH!!!! Anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your arse if you like, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, I see the attacks against organisers and I understand the need to be able to
say you did the right thing. But notice that once you&amp;rsquo;ve protected yourselves, the blame is back on the
minorities for not meeting your criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of a blind CFP is to protect the selectors, then let&amp;rsquo;s not pretend it&amp;rsquo;s an answer to increasing diversity
of speakers, it&amp;rsquo;s a piece in a larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;an-abstract-is-not-a-representation-of-your-talk&#34;&gt;An abstract is not a representation of your talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can emphasise this enough: blind CFPs have a very big weakness - there is no direct correlation between
a good abstract and a good talk. I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a bunch of talks online lately, and I watched one with an abstract
that absolutely called to me - here was the missing piece for a technology that I simply can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around. I
gave an hour of my life to that talk, each minute I was wondering when this person would get to the bits mentioned
in the abstract, so I watched it all the way to the end. They never delivered what the abstract promised, and their
meandering style meant I learnt almost nothing from the talk. That&amp;rsquo;s an hour of my life I&amp;rsquo;ll never get back. Good
thing I was playing computer games as well at the time, if I&amp;rsquo;d paid money for that I would have been very peeved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another weakness in this process - if you go to a number of conferences (like I do) you kinda learn which
speakers are doing
which talks.  If I submit my &amp;ldquo;AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong??&amp;rdquo;
talk to a blind process, if there&amp;rsquo;s anyone on the selection committee who&amp;rsquo;s even vaguely involved in the Java or MongoDB
spaces, they&amp;rsquo;ll know that&amp;rsquo;s me. And they can Google the talk and decide whether they like it (or with any luck, the
buzz-word crammed title will do the job and they&amp;rsquo;ll say yes, although probably AngularJS is so 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An abstract is like your presentation in the same way that your CV is like your ability to do your job - there&amp;rsquo;s a skill
to writing good abstracts (or CVs), but mastery of that skill does not necessarily mean mastery of the thing it
represents - the ability to present or the ability to do the job.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be sold on a blind process
being a good way to build &amp;ldquo;the best content available for the conference&amp;rdquo; until this disconnect is somehow solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;for-goodness-sake-trisha-the-postscript-is-nearly-longer-than-the-original-post&#34;&gt;For goodness sake Trisha, the postscript is nearly longer than the original post&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to feedback from a bunch of people, and I have learnt more things (thanks everyone!). I am more sold on
a blind CFP being maybe part of a bigger process. But I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe it fixes the &amp;ldquo;we need more women speakers&amp;rdquo;
problem, which was the original claim that I wanted to dispute. Conferences have to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more active to address
this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am not sold on an abstract being a fair representation of the quality of a talk. Maybe a more realistic &amp;ldquo;blind&amp;rdquo;
audition would be to give the talk to an audience, like a user group, who rated the talk:
the organisers wouldn&amp;rsquo;t watch the talk, but they could use the ratings to decide. Yes, the user group could also
have biases that affect their rating, but when the speaker gives the talk at the conference, those attendees will also
have their biases too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blindness is not a realistic option, we just have to keep putting women (and other non-white-straight-men) in front of
audiences until it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a novelty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Are Blind CFPs Really The Answer?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 11 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Off the back of &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/&#34;&gt;yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt;, I received a number of comments and questions
around blind &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/&#34;&gt;CFPs&lt;/a&gt; (Call For Papers - usually to get into a conference you submit to a CFP) for
conferences. I often hear it said that a blind CFP will fix, or at least improve, the diversity imbalance at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t believe this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I should caveat this with: this is going to be a blog post based on my experiences and chats with people, and I
have zero science to back this up. Sorry. But I do have some numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of London conferences that I won&amp;rsquo;t name (because I haven&amp;rsquo;t asked their permission not because they&amp;rsquo;ve
done anything wrong) that in some years have received only 2 from around 200 (or more) submissions from women. These
conferences have accepted 100% of the submissions from women, and then been open to criticism for not having enough women
speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blind CFP to remove unconscious bias from the selection committee might have resulted in zero women speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I know the next argument is that advertising a blind CFP might encourage a wider diversity of speakers to apply. This
does seem to work in some parts of the industry (I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking to women from tech scenes that don&amp;rsquo;t intersect with mine
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see that we have different problems in different segments of the wider development world). But for my
world, which is largely Java, with some forays into Agile, NoSQL, Open Source, and Enterprise, the women I speak to
aren&amp;rsquo;t scared they&amp;rsquo;ll be discriminated against if they put their name on a CFP. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to
lose by submitting and being rejected. They&amp;rsquo;re more afraid they&amp;rsquo;ll be accepted, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll have to give a
presentation! No, the women I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to in my world don&amp;rsquo;t submit because they don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready, they don&amp;rsquo;t think they
have anything to talk about, and they&amp;rsquo;re worried about the sorts of questions they&amp;rsquo;ll get asked when they&amp;rsquo;re standing up
there. Those fears aren&amp;rsquo;t allayed by having a blind CFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are any fears of being judged as a woman, it&amp;rsquo;s when we&amp;rsquo;re standing up in front of people at the conference, and
no amount of blindness during the CFP process is going to make us feel better about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, personally, I find the idea of a blind CFP terrifying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, if you have such a problem with judging people based on race or gender that you have to anonymise the
selection process, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I want to speak at your conference where my gender will be blatantly on show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, when I was starting out as a speaker, I was new to writing titles and abstracts and expected that they would
not be good enough to get in. With a blind CFP I would never find out why as I could never ask for feedback on my
anonymous abstract. As a novice speaker, I expected my gender would help me be selected, not hinder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, as an experienced speaker I know my abstract-writing has not really improved, but I know my presenting has,
and I know there are videos of me out there doing a good job as a presenter, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is my audition tape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was starting out as a speaker, I knew there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough women presenters around. And although I hate the idea
of positive discrimination and hate the idea that men might think I got into my position merely because I&amp;rsquo;m female, I knew
that being a woman made me stand out in all those submissions. And I knew that enough conferences would take a chance on
me, if only to improve their diversity, and that&amp;rsquo;s all I needed to bootstrap my speaking career - once I had spoken at
enough conferences, once I had videos of me doing that, I would find it much easier to get into the next conferences.
And that&amp;rsquo;s worked. And now, as an experienced (female) speaker, I fear blind CFPs as they won&amp;rsquo;t know who I am or what I&amp;rsquo;m
capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion as a female speaker. But I&amp;rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to be on the programme committee for a couple
of conferences, and after three years or so of speaking at conferences I know a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of conference organisers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s
assume you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;merely&amp;rdquo; trying to build the best conference you can around your subject whilst not discriminating against
anyone (i.e. let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re not going out of your way to actively promote diversity). How can you do this when you only
have abstracts and titles to go on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am aware of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903&#34;&gt;studies around blind auditions for orchestras&lt;/a&gt;. And I understand
how tempting it is to try to apply that to our world, since it has had an effect on the number of women in orchestras
(but let&amp;rsquo;s not get too excited here, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about an increase from 5% to 25% over thirty years&amp;hellip;). I think
blind auditions would work really well for coding - we can look at just the code, without knowing anything about the
physical body behind the code, and figure out if that person is good enough for us. We could even do blind pair
programming, using screen sharing and chat (actually that&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll patent that!). Because
the thing you&amp;rsquo;ve anonymised (the code) is the output you really care about in a programming job. If you communicate via
chat you can even measure someone&amp;rsquo;s communication skills without judging them physically, another vital skill for
being part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a talk abstract is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the output we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.  Sure, a good title and abstract will attract attendees to the
conference and bums on seats in the actual talk. But the output you&amp;rsquo;re looking for is the presenter - their style, their
approach to the topic, their ability to hold attention, their ability to impart information. We&amp;rsquo;re not always looking
for the same things either, an interesting topic presented nervously but logically is fine, as is an entertaining
presenter reminding us of fundamentals we already know (and any other combination of strengths and weaknesses). An abstract
can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how good the presentation is going to be. Evaluating a presentation on a blind abstract would be like
evaluating those musicians on a couple of paragraphs explaining what they&amp;rsquo;re going to play and how they&amp;rsquo;re going to
try to make you feel when they play it - the words could sound great, but the musician might not even be able to play
the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best audition you can have as a presenter is to, well, present. Videos, audio clips, even screencasts. But the
problem with presenting is that it&amp;rsquo;s so freaking obvious that you&amp;rsquo;re a woman (or other variation on
non-white-straight-male).  If you can&amp;rsquo;t objectively evaluate a presentation without taking away the presenter&amp;rsquo;s
physical body (for colour
or gender or whatever), then you&amp;rsquo;ve got real problems. Your audience is going to be faced with that physical body for an
hour of their life, and you can bet they&amp;rsquo;ll be judging them too.  You want to be damned sure that you&amp;rsquo;ve selected a
competent presenter, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stand by that choice. Saying &amp;ldquo;oh, well, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem boring in their
abstract&amp;rdquo; is not going to make the audience feel like you did a good job of the selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another point about non-blind selection processes, other than the process allowing you to select on presentation
ability rather than abstract-writing ability: you can be more active in promoting diversity. I am against &amp;ldquo;affirmative
action&amp;rdquo;, but if the proportion of women submitting presentations is lower than the proportion of women in the field, there&amp;rsquo;s
something missing.  Here are some of the things you can do if you identify a lack of a certain demographic - as usual,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;, but you could equally argue this for any demographic, even not-enough-C#-developers or
too-many-startups-not-enough-enterprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to relevant user groups and communities asking them to submit.  In London for example, there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/&#34;&gt;Ladies Who Code&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/women-who-code-london/&#34;&gt;Women Who Code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://london.girlgeekdinners.com/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Dinners&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/&#34;&gt;PyLadies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-London/&#34;&gt;Rails Girls&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data/&#34;&gt;Women in Data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geekgirlmeetup.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Girl Geek Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/WIGJMeetup/&#34;&gt;Women in Games Jobs&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://girlsintechuk.com/community/&#34;&gt;Girls in Tech&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Geek-Girls-Unite-London/&#34;&gt;Girl Geeks Unite&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://witi.meetup.com/cities/gb/17/london/&#34;&gt;whole host of women techies meetups&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip; And don&amp;rsquo;t think I psychically
know about all those
because I have two X chromosomes, I found half of those just now, in less than two minutes, by Googling
&amp;ldquo;Girl Geeks London&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Women Tech London&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the faces of the women you do want to have speak (or the women on your programme committee, or both) on your
website - showing these women sends the message that this conference is for women. It should also impact the diversity
of your attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach out to specific women speakers and ask them to present. &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this before&lt;/a&gt;,
women speakers are few and far between, and a) they get
booked in advance and b) are busy enough not to have to (or want to) submit via a CFP process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers&#34;&gt;more ideas here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s more - you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to drain the pool dry of known competent speakers-who-tick-some-diversity-box. With
a non-blind process you can actively improve the submissions you do have, assuming you&amp;rsquo;re not one of the conferences
suffering from a complete lack of submissions from those people. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to increase the number of women
presenting at your conference, if you have women submitting but they don&amp;rsquo;t quite meet your criteria (maybe the abstract
is weak, the title isn&amp;rsquo;t catchy, or maybe the presenter simply isn&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet) you, as the conference organiser, are
in the perfect position to mentor these people: you can help them re-write their abstracts; you can offer them mentoring
and training for presenting. If there&amp;rsquo;s no record of them presenting but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in evaluating their ability,
you can set them up with a user group to present at - as a conference organiser, you have the network contacts that
new speakers might not. You can run sessions aimed at people who have never done public speaking (I&amp;rsquo;ve run a session
like this four times now, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; and at Ladies Who Code -
I had &lt;em&gt;over 70&lt;/em&gt; RSVPs for the last London Ladies Who Code session, twice the number of the last LJC session,
so there are plenty of women interested in breaking into this field, who are looking for training, who don&amp;rsquo;t feel ready
to present yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are my points?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blind process of selection can be applied to something where the output you&amp;rsquo;re selecting for can be effectively
anonymised: music auditions, code, technical writing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blind process where you select based on criteria that are not the end result will only be effective
if it&amp;rsquo;s the selection process is biased, or if submissions to the selection process are lower
from discriminated-against-groups because they fear a biased selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those conferences that are getting very tiny numbers of submissions from women (I&amp;rsquo;m picking women as the example
but you can pick any group you want), a blind process could lead to even fewer selected women speakers. Instead of
switching to a blind process, you&amp;rsquo;re probably going to want to check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the messaging around your conference (remember masculine words like rock star, ninja, competitive, hardcore,
challenging etc &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tum.de/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/short/article/31438/&#34;&gt;put women off applying to jobs&lt;/a&gt;, the same probably applies to technical conferences)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;subliminal messages on your website/info (one of the conferences I mentioned, for example, sent out a couple of emails
containing photos of previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences which happened to only show men - this was not even representative of
the conference, but it can have an unexpectedly big effect on the subconscious)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have you showcased the diversity of the conference, or previous years&amp;rsquo; conferences, with photos, interviews, testamonials?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-blind submission process allows you to be more active in promoting diversity - instead of hoping that the
submissions are representative of the diversity in your community, and that selecting the most interesting talks
will naturally lead to improved diversity, with a non-blind process you can track exactly how many women are submitting,
address problems in this area early and offer mentoring to those who aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready yet. Remember that &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/0-qualified/&#34;&gt;women
only apply for jobs they feel 100% qualified for&lt;/a&gt;
and take fewer chances, they might need that extra push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that implementing a blind CFP will address the lack of diversity in conference speakers. I
know it helps in some circles, but I personally think that conference selection committees should a) be much better at
identifying their own biases and actively attempting to overcome them b) be active in improving the diversity of
their conference, and c) be offering feedback and mentoring to those who are not quite ready yet in order to improve
the overall ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity isn&amp;rsquo;t going to accidentally happen when we stop looking at gender and race and other visible you-don&amp;rsquo;t-belong-here
cues.  Diversity is only going to happen if people fight for it, and if we actively train, mentor, and support those
trying to break through the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/blind_cfps_2&#34;&gt;follow up&lt;/a&gt; based off responses to this post, covering additional questions raised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>I&#39;m so tired of it all</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/i_am_so_tired_of_it_all/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;We work so hard to promote equality, to fight for the rights of people who are not middle-class
white men, and time and again it just feels like we&amp;rsquo;re not getting anywhere.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.internationalwomensday.com/&#34;&gt;International Women&amp;rsquo;s
Day&lt;/a&gt; highlights the issues that face women all around the world, and make our
women-in-tech problem
look like a genuine &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/firstworldproblems&#34;&gt;First World Problem&lt;/a&gt;, and yet we can&amp;rsquo;t even get that right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave up. This weekend I thought, fuck it. I&amp;rsquo;ve done my bit. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the phase in my
career where being a woman was a disadvantage and somehow arrived out the other side - in my position, in my job, it&amp;rsquo;s
an advantage, and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to change anything to improve things for my career. I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry on doing my job to the best
of my ability, but I&amp;rsquo;m no longer going to let this diversity thing drain my energy - nothing ever seems to make a difference anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, four (white, middle-class, English-speaking) men who I know well, who
I have seen by their actions are champions of women in technology, who have personally mentored
me in some way or another, have been accused of not thinking about women techies, not encouraging them - have
been accused of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third year of being on the programme committee for QCon, I could see we had achieved far more to promote diversity
than ever before, but it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much work to get that far, and there&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; more to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another conference I have great affection for which has never previously suffered badly from a lack of women speakers
received practically
zero submissions for full conference talks from women this year. The submissions that did come in were from the usual
suspects, the speakers who one calls upon when desperately trying to shore up the gender diversity of your speaker line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sevilla Java User Group, which I started, with my money, which I present at regularly, has had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; female
developers attend who were not previously friends. Apparently the impact of visible female role models is far smaller than
I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so much work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s thankless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the men who support the women, they get attacked by both sides - by women, for not
doing enough, or sometimes for simply being privileged white men, by men and women for fighting for something that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact them, and by men for betraying their gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the women, it&amp;rsquo;s the same but more so: some women accuse us of not doing enough, some women sneer at what we&amp;rsquo;re doing,
telling us we already have equality, men and women think you&amp;rsquo;re in it just to improve your own life, and the men, well,
many men genuinely don&amp;rsquo;t understand the problems (and it&amp;rsquo;s exhausting to explain), and some are outright hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to find men allies.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone else, but at this stage in my career I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by men
who are all allies. And I can honestly say that any professional struggles I&amp;rsquo;ve had in recent years I can see are suffered
by my colleagues of the opposite sex, so I know they&amp;rsquo;re not because of my gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that our male allies suffer the same way we do, even though they get even less out of fighting our battles
than we do. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s fair that they are attacked by both genders, and have to put up with unfair, unjust
criticism and accusations. After all, look at some of the vile, hate-filled messages thrown at women leading the charge -
that&amp;rsquo;s abuse. Some of these women fear for their lives.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live that life, and I despair that we live in a
society that can&amp;rsquo;t seem to prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m a bit burnt out. So my friends are finding it tough. But this is a marathon, not a sprint.  And I never did this
for me anyway. I care about diversity because it matters. I try to change the gender balance specifically, because that&amp;rsquo;s an area I
might be able to impact, one I have a chance of understanding. I care about equality, about justice, because
it matters. And I do my tiny part to try and drown out the hate, the anger, the &amp;ldquo;get back into the kitchen, woman&amp;rdquo;
because those things make me feel sick, because &amp;ldquo;you can be whoever you want to be&amp;rdquo; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a lie, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come
with caveats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or energy for large-scale revolutions, but I will carry on trying to make a small difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By trying to be a role model for anyone who can relate to me, whatever their colour, gender, or sexual orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By being visible as a woman techie, who does woman techie things, who&amp;rsquo;s also a human being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By calling out (quietly and personally, at least at first) where I see things that might give the wrong message: e.g.
e-mailing conference organisers to point out they only have white men in their line up; private messaging people to
let them know their comments could be taken the wrong way; pointing out to user group leaders that their meetup
page shows only men at their events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By continuing to give an honest view of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a female Java developer, especially if these
experiences are different to those of other women - one woman&amp;rsquo;s view does not represent every woman&amp;rsquo;s view, if more
of us tell our different tales, we have a better view of the whole ecosystem (and its inhabitants).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By sharing not only the negatives, but the many positives of working in such a varied and rapidly changing profession.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired of fighting, however tiny my efforts are. But I&amp;rsquo;m more tired of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Content and resources for the Java 8 in Anger presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vJUG video of Java 8 in Anger shows the Java 8 version of this talk in
its clearest form. Here I also have links to other material I&amp;rsquo;ve published
on this topic, and to the resources I used to create the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 this talk has evolved to also contain some Java 9 features too, and
the latest version even shows how to use TDD to help figure out which stream

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;more-details&#34;&gt;More details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you might want to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/why-java-8-1&#34;&gt;Why Java 8?&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2015/10/30/five-java-8-features/&#34;&gt;5 Java 8 Features That
You Won&amp;rsquo;t Be Able To Live Without&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow my tutorial on &amp;ldquo;Building Java 8 Applications with Microservices&amp;rdquo;, which is a deep dive into
the code I write in the presentation - 3 hours of material where I go into each section in a lot more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=/zztT3fScng&amp;offerid=163217.2348574&amp;type=2&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Ftitle%2F9780134312187&#34;&gt;&lt;IMG border=0 src=&#34;http://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=9780134312187&amp;type=d&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src=&#34;http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=/zztT3fScng&amp;bids=163217.2348574&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0&#34; &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-java-8/9780134312170/&#34;&gt;watch this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; with a Safari Books Online subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-920950&#34;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; for Oracle Technology Network in which I go
into some of the interesting code sections in more detail. It also shows more clearly some of the features of
IntelliJ IDEA that make the transition to Java 8 a bit easier for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;project-code&#34;&gt;Project code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The full application code on the master branch branch of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense/&#34;&gt;sense repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to play along from the beginning of the demo, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense/tree/starting_point&#34;&gt;starting_point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a branch which shows the steps of the application as a series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/sense/tree/steps&#34;&gt;independent steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will find a whole mess of various branches. The conference names are the final working code demoed at that conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of the resources I used to create the talk, and can be used to find more information about
any of the technologies or approaches used during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java 9 is just around the corner, and yet many of us developers have yet to use Java 8 features in an application. The
goal of this presentation is to move beyond slide-sized examples of streams and lambdas, and to show how to build a
fully working end-to-end application using as few external dependencies as possible, and the latest version of Java.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this session, Trisha will build a Java 8 application live. This application will consume a real-time feed of high
velocity data, contain services that make sense of the data, and present it in a JavaFX dashboard. Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll
encounter Java 8 streams, lambdas, new ways of working with collections, and bump into the new date and time API.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>The State of Java</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_state_of_java_update/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we
find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please,
DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us
an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to use Java 8 in real life, so this could not have been better timed - I got to ask the guys a bunch
of questions about the intentions behind some of the Java 8 features, and the current vision for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My notes from the session:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html&#34;&gt;Lambdas&lt;/a&gt; could be just a syntax change,
but they could be more than that - they could impact the language, the libraries
and the JVM. They could have a positive impact on performance, and this work can continue to go on through small
updates to Java that don&amp;rsquo;t impact the syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html&#34;&gt;Streams&lt;/a&gt; are a pipeline of operations, made possible/easier/more readable by lambdas. The aim is to make operations
on collections easier and more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Old World Order, you had to care about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to perform certain operations. With streams, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to
tell the computer exactly how it&amp;rsquo;s done, you can simply say what operations you want performed. This makes it easier
for developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streams will take all the operations you pass in and perform them in a single pass of the data, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have
to write multiple loops to perform multiple operations on the same data structure, or tie your brain in knots figuring
out how to do it in one loop. There are also no intermediate data structures when you use streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The implementation
can be optimised under the covers (e.g. not performing the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; operation if the data is already ordered correctly),
and the developer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. Java can introduce further optimisations in later releases without
changing the API or impacting the code a developer has already written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These new features in Java have a focus on readability, since code is much more often read than written.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The operations are easier to parallelise, because the developer is no longer dictating the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; - multiple &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops
might not be easy to parallelise, but a series of operations can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html&#34;&gt;Default methods&lt;/a&gt; and
new support for &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html#static&#34;&gt;static methods on interfaces&lt;/a&gt; are interesting.
I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten you could put static methods on interfaces and I&amp;rsquo;m going to sneak them into my latest project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html&#34;&gt;Nashorn&lt;/a&gt; is here to replace Rhino. Personally I haven&amp;rsquo;t worked in the sort of environment that would need server-side
JavaScript so this whole area has passed me by somewhat, but seems it might be interesting for Node.js or creating
a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop&#34;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt;
in JavaScript that you want to run on the JVM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/java_8_s_new_type&#34;&gt;additional annotation support in Java 8&lt;/a&gt;
will be useful for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;Java EE&lt;/a&gt;.  As this is something I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing
with (specifically web sockets) I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this, but it seems like it will be a while before this filters into
the Java EE that&amp;rsquo;s used on a daily basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html&#34;&gt;Mission Control and Flight Recorder&lt;/a&gt; - look interesting.  Feel like I should play with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people are skipping straight from Java 6 to 8 - the new language features and improved performance are major driving
factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml&#34;&gt;End of public updates of Java 7 in April&lt;/a&gt;. Having libraries that, um&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; adoption of the latest version of
Java makes life a lot easier for those who develop the Java language, as they can concentrate on moving the language
forward and not be tied down supporting old versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javadb/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaDB&lt;/a&gt;,
or my memory has completely discarded it. I had no idea what it was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9&lt;/a&gt; is well under way, check out the JEPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1&#34;&gt;JEP process&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/&#34;&gt;Jigsaw&lt;/a&gt; was explained, and actually I could see myself using it for the project I&amp;rsquo;m working on right now. I had a look
to see if I could use it via the OpenJDK, but it looks like the groundwork is there, but not the actual modules themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/g1-intro-jsp-135488.html&#34;&gt;G1 Garbage Collector&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;the go forward GC&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s the one that&amp;rsquo;s being actively worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the first I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193&#34;&gt;Enhanced Volatiles&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m so behind the times!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to internal packages is going away in Java 9. So
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t use any &lt;code&gt;sun.*&lt;/code&gt; packages&lt;/a&gt;.
Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.dzone.com/articles/jdeps-jdk-8-command-line&#34;&gt;jdeps&lt;/a&gt; to identify any
dependencies in your code that need to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and, looking further ahead than Java 9, we have &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/169&#34;&gt;value types&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/&#34;&gt;Project Valhalla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/kulla/&#34;&gt;REPL for Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;possibly a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/198&#34;&gt;lightweight JSON API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~psandoz/varhandles/jvmls14-varHandles.pdf&#34;&gt;VarHandles&lt;/a&gt; were also mentioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the guys mentioned a &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/2y5Pv4yN0b0&#34;&gt;talk by Brian Goetz called &amp;ldquo;Stewardship: the Sobering Parts&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which has gone onto my
to-watch list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ideas&#34;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became clear throughout the talk there are plenty of ideas that we could explore in later presentations.  If you want to see
any of the following, add a comment or ping me or &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or Meetup and we&amp;rsquo;ll try and schedule it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you can present on any of these topics and want to come to a beautiful, sunny city with amazing food to
do so, drop me a line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JCP, the purpose, the processes, the people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adopt a JSR, Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Date/Time (JSR310)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaFX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code optimisation vs Data optimisation (I honestly don&amp;rsquo;t know what this means, but I wrote it down in my notes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java EE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;further-reading&#34;&gt;Further Reading&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449370772/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1449370772&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=GGWNXKE672H3G2FY&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&amp;rsquo;s Lambdas and Streams&lt;/a&gt; book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617291994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1617291994&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=KDGWBWOK2S6FVS6F&#34;&gt;Java 8 in Action&lt;/a&gt; has details on other Java 8 features like Date and Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321927761/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321927761&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkId=7VJH32FI5ZVEDOMW&#34;&gt;Java 8 for the Really Impatient&lt;/a&gt; covers JavaFX too, and highlights some Java 7 features you might like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Goetz did a great talk last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLksirK9nnE&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Lambdas in Java: A peek under the hood&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I had to watch it twice before even half of the info sank in, but it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephen Colebourne, the guy behind Joda time and the new Date and Time API, has &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/87157763&#34;&gt;this talk about the new API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/&#34;&gt;Java 9 OpenJDK page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Workshop: AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/resources/angular_java_groovy_mongodb_workshop/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/resources/angular_java_groovy_mongodb_workshop/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Setup required for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/tutorial/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-and-mongodb-all-together&#34;&gt;AngularJS/HTML5/Groovy/Java/MongoDB tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for QCon London 2015.
Sign up with code SPEAKGEE100 for £100 off the price!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-is-this-for&#34;&gt;Who is this for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is aimed at Java developers who want to learn more about how
to rapidly prototype applications using web front-end technologies with JVM back-end technologies. The workshop may be
suitable for developers who don&amp;rsquo;t normally use Java as their primary language,
but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an introduction to Java and familiarity with server-side development of some kind is assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript is expected, but previous experience of Groovy or MongoDB is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop is not suitable for people who have no programming experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hands-on workshop, bring a laptop set up according to the following instructions - you will be writing code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/klw9pIuTICM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created my very first screencast! This video takes you through all the steps you need to go through in order to be
setup for the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup instructions below are the same process, so you can copy &amp;amp; paste where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am assuming you already have a version of the Java SDK downloaded. For this workshop, Java 7 or above should work, but
I recommend you &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html&#34;&gt;download the latest version of Java 8&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re not already using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new work area for this tutorial. For the rest of these instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve put
mine in &lt;code&gt;~/Projects/workshops/qcon2015&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-mongodb&#34;&gt;Installing MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;MongoDB 3.0.0-rc8&lt;/a&gt;, but version 2.6 will be fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;Download MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and unzip/install it.  Unless you prefer to put it
somewhere else, I suggest you unzip it to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/mongodb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to create the directory for the data to go into. Create a &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; directory in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that you
have a folder at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the command line, start MongoDB to make sure everything is working.  From the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;linuxosx&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;windows&#34;&gt;Windows:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
MongoDB should be running on localhost and port 27017
&lt;p&gt;Connect to the shell to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s working:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;linuxosx-1&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;windows-1&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You should see something like:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~\Projects\workshops\qcon2015&amp;gt;monogdb\bin\mongo.exe
MongoDB shell version: 2.8.0-rc5
connecting to: test
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.

        http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user
&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-your-project&#34;&gt;Creating your project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;the Cafelito project&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/cafelito&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a terminal/command line, navigate to this location, and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;linuxosx-2&#34;&gt;Linux/OSX&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./gradlew check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;windows-2&#34;&gt;Windows&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gradlew.bat check
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This should download all the required dependencies.
&lt;p&gt;Open in your favourite IDE and import this directory as a new project. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA 14&lt;/a&gt; and showing a number of its tricks. If you&amp;rsquo;re using IntelliJ IDEA and you
import this project as a Gradle project, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to do the above step, IntelliJ will download and import
the dependencies for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use Eclipse or
Netbeans (or whatever your favourite IDE is) but I&amp;rsquo;m out of practice using those IDEs and might not be able to help you out as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-now&#34;&gt;And now&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be ready to begin: you have a working instance of MongoDB, a skeleton project that we&amp;rsquo;ll be working with, and all the
dependencies should have been downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Part 2</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij_2/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I&amp;rsquo;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
&lt;a href=&#34;post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij&#34;&gt;last post about IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt;, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&amp;rsquo;t know.  And this is all just in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; section!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigate-between-methods&#34;&gt;Navigate between methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I knew you could use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-2.Structure&#34;&gt;structure thingie&lt;/a&gt;
(Ctrl+F12) to let you navigate to methods in your class (although I never actually
use it, it somehow never sticks in my head).  What I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Navigation#Navigation-5.Navigatebetweenmethods&#34;&gt;jump between methods&lt;/a&gt;
using Alt+Up/Down arrows.  This strikes me as being super useful, especially to browse tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;refactoring-string-fragments&#34;&gt;Refactoring String Fragments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted this feature so many times, but could never find it or get it to work - did you know you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-4.Stringfragments&#34;&gt;refactor out parts of a
hardcoded string&lt;/a&gt;
into variable/field/constant? Select the section of the String you want to extract, and use the normal &amp;ldquo;Extract&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
shortcuts - e.g. Ctrl+Alt+V to extract it into a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this before and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it and it does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;invert-boolean&#34;&gt;Invert Boolean&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a keyboard shortcut mapped by default, but using &amp;ldquo;Refactor -&amp;gt; Invert Boolean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (or using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/index.html#toc_0&#34;&gt;our newly discovered&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; shortcut of Shift+Ctrl+A and typing &amp;ldquo;Invert&amp;rdquo;) you can tell IntelliJ you want
a boolean field to mean the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; thing, and it will
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-6.Invertboolean&#34;&gt;flip the meaning everywhere&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, you might have an &lt;code&gt;saved&lt;/code&gt; flag, and you now want it to mean &lt;code&gt;notSaved&lt;/code&gt; - IntelliJ will make sure the
&lt;code&gt;isSaved&lt;/code&gt; method returns &lt;code&gt;!notSaved&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;magic-refactor-suggestions&#34;&gt;Magic Refactor Suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t always know exactly what refactoring operation you want to perform, and IntelliJ is ready to help - it can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Refactoring+Basics#RefactoringBasics-10.Refactorthis&#34;&gt;suggest refactorings available in the current context&lt;/a&gt;
using the catchy magic incantation Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T.  Seems useful, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;m not going to remember that
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlight-implementedoverridden-methods&#34;&gt;Highlight implemented/overridden methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love everything about IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to find usages of things - finding where methods are called, finding
implementations of a method, highlighting usages of a field, method or variable&amp;hellip; What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Find+Usages#FindUsages-6.Highlightimplementedandoverriddenmethods&#34;&gt;highlight the methods that implement or override a specific interface or superclass&lt;/a&gt;.
For some people, this might not add much, as your little &amp;ldquo;I override something&amp;rdquo; icon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/override.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overrides Something&#34; title=&#34;Overrides Something&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;combined with the &lt;code&gt;@Override&lt;/code&gt; annotation, might tell you all you need to know. But that only really works if you&amp;rsquo;re implementing a
a single interface.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve correctly separated your concerns, you might implement several interfaces, and want to know
which are the methods from a particular one.  That&amp;rsquo;s where Shift+Ctrl+F7 on the &amp;ldquo;extends&amp;rdquo; keyword comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-individual-inspection-by-name&#34;&gt;Run individual inspection by name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections&#34;&gt;inspections&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot.  They&amp;rsquo;re especially
useful if you have a codebase that doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite conform to your ideal standards, so you can&amp;rsquo;t yet turn on automated
checks like checkstyle to break the build when the code doesn&amp;rsquo;t
conform - there&amp;rsquo;s an initial step where first you need to clean up the code.  Inspections are great, because you can
have IntelliJ give you little yellow marks to show where things are suboptimal, and aim to check in only files without
little yellow marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know, is that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-6.Runasingleinspection&#34;&gt;run a single inspection&lt;/a&gt;
on files in any scope.  So if, for example, you wanted to
make sure that the code you&amp;rsquo;ve touched in this change has no unused bits, like
unused parameters or unused/untested methods, you could press Shift+Alt+Ctrl+I and type &amp;ldquo;unused&amp;rdquo;. Select the
&amp;ldquo;Unused Declaration&amp;rdquo; inspection and choose to run this on all uncommitted files.  This will tell you where you can
clean up your code, and every commit should make your codebase that little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;saving-power-with-highlighting&#34;&gt;Saving Power With Highlighting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not know you could easily &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Inspections#Inspections-7.Highlightinglevelandpowersavemode&#34;&gt;alter the active errors/warnings&lt;/a&gt;,
and use that to save power.  Quite Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;auto-indent-your-lines&#34;&gt;Auto indent your lines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost obsessively reformat my code as I go, pressing &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-1.Reformatcode&#34;&gt;Ctrl+Alt+L&lt;/a&gt;
almost like a muscle twitch. What I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered, though, is that there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Style+and+Formatting#CodeStyleandFormatting-2.Autoindentlines&#34;&gt;shortcut which will just fix the line
indentation&lt;/a&gt;,
which is probably 80% of what I need anyway - Ctrl+Alt+I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fix-evil-string-concatenation&#34;&gt;Fix Evil String Concatenation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice this one earlier - do you know how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve gone around and manually changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&amp;quot;This thing &amp;quot; + something + &amp;quot; is &amp;quot; + somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.printf(&amp;quot;This thing %s is %s%n&amp;quot;, something, somethingElse);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you??? Anyway you don&amp;rsquo;t need to - Alt+Enter inside the params &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Intentions#Intentions-2.Stringconcatenation&#34;&gt;will suggest the replacement and do it for
you&lt;/a&gt;. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vcs-quick-access&#34;&gt;VCS Quick Access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t use IntelliJ to the best of its abilities is the Git integration.  I&amp;rsquo;ve
been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/&#34;&gt;SourceTree&lt;/a&gt; combined with IntelliJ to do most of my VCS management
(I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m just not a command line
person, I need to actually &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; it). With the new laptop, I haven&amp;rsquo;t installed SourceTree yet and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and
do everything via the IDE.  Previously I used the right-click menu mostly for managing VCS operations, occasionally the
VCS menu, and did most stuff in the &amp;ldquo;Changes&amp;rdquo; window.  But now I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Alt+&amp;quot;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; (Ctrl+V on the mac) to
bring up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Version+Control+Basics#VersionControlBasics-4.VCSoperationsquicklist&#34;&gt;menu of git-shaped operations for this
context&lt;/a&gt;.
To stop you having to hunt all over the keyboard to
find what on earth a &amp;ldquo;Back Quote&amp;rdquo; is, it&amp;rsquo;s `, which on both my UK and US (Windows) keyboards is in the top left
corner of your keyboard (on the Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s on the bottom left next to the shift, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need it since your
shortcut is different anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amend-commits&#34;&gt;Amend Commits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just discovered that you can commit a change which smushes up into your last commit and fixes it.  I&amp;rsquo;m assuming it commits the
new changes and (potentially) an updated commit message into the last change.  I really wish I&amp;rsquo;d known about this
earlier, on a number of occasions in the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve done this either manually or by doing a rather
dangerous soft reset.  I will &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be using this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/amend-commit.png&#34; alt=&#34;Amend Commit&#34; title=&#34;Amend Commit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cursor-as-a-breakpoint&#34;&gt;The Cursor as a Breakpoint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Debugger#Debugger-5.Runtocursor&#34;&gt;use the cursor as a temporary breakpoint&lt;/a&gt;?
I did not.  Well, now you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;labelling-changes&#34;&gt;Labelling Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope by now none of us developers are doing that icky thing of having &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee/status/529299964787449856&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Copy of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Backup of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; filenames
and directories&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of our versions.  We&amp;rsquo;re all using a VCS of course.  But if you&amp;rsquo;re being strict about making
sure that every commit leads to a working build (we all do that, right&amp;hellip;?) then sometimes even distributed file systems
like git, with its local branches, are too heavyweight for experiments and debugging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ has Local History, which I personally think you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; rely on, but has occasionally saved my bacon in
times of strife.  It also does this really nice thing (automatically) where it labels versions where the tests passed,
so you&amp;rsquo;ve got some level of confidence that at that point in time, at that revision, things weren&amp;rsquo;t hideously broken.
At the very least, they must have compiled.  What I did not know is that you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Local+History#LocalHistory-6.Putlabel&#34;&gt;add your own labels&lt;/a&gt;, so you could
label some local, non-committed version of the file as &amp;ldquo;feature x works but y doesn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; (or probably something much
shorter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it looks useful. As I say though, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement for VCS, but a suppliment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So, that&#39;s the end of Week One at JetBrains, and already I&#39;ve learnt a whole heap of things.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more to
come, so stay tuned!</description>

            <title>New IntelliJ Tricks I Learnt Today</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Day three of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures&#34;&gt;brand new job&lt;/a&gt; - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&amp;rsquo;m
already a &amp;ldquo;Power User&amp;rdquo;, to see if there&amp;rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; read it.  Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&amp;rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t previously known,
and they&amp;rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&amp;rsquo;t know was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s today&amp;rsquo;s list, and feel free to laugh at me and be smug in my direction if you already knew these things (note: I
have upgraded to IntelliJ 14, and at the time of writing I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of these features are new and which are
simply previously undiscovered):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigate-directly-to-an-action-or-option&#34;&gt;Navigate directly to an action or option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press Shift+Ctrl+A (Windows) or Shift+Cmd+A (Mac) and start typing the name of the thing you want to do, or the setting
you want to change. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this especially useful now I&amp;rsquo;m back on Windows and I don&amp;rsquo;t have that nice helpful typing
box on the help menu that will take me straight to the menu item I want.  But what&amp;rsquo;s most useful about this for me today,
as I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a new profile on a new laptop (more on the new laptop later, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t defeat me utterly) is that
from here, you can turn various settings on and off without having to navigate through the settings screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/action.png&#34; alt=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34; title=&#34;Navigate to Action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statement-completion&#34;&gt;Statement completion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never knew there was a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-4.Statementcompletion&#34;&gt;shortcut for finishing off a statement&lt;/a&gt;,
all that Java boilerplate you need to keep the compiler happy - semi colons and curly brackets and everything.  But
there is, and I can see it being super useful, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using other bits of IntelliJ code completion to
create the core of your line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;issue-tracker-integration&#34;&gt;Issue tracker integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure loads of people are already using integration with their favourite issue tracker, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought
about this as something that I really cared about.  But I was watching the intro videos for YouTrack (not surprisingly
I&amp;rsquo;ll be using this instead of Jira during my time at JetBrains) and when I saw
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2_3Y1jLm5U&#34;&gt;how the IDE integration worked&lt;/a&gt;, I
suddenly realised how this small thing can add up to save thousands of keystrokes over time, not to mention saving
precious navigational seconds and window-switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, just the ability to generate at least the start of the commit message is a saving in time, and adds to project
consistency if all your developers are doing the same thing.  On my last project we only just realised we all quoted the
Jira issues in subtly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;settings-shortcut-keys&#34;&gt;Settings shortcut keys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I initially started using IntelliJ in anger back in 2008, I was very much a point-and-click type user. Over time,
pair programming with keyboard-super-users and giving live demos with very limited time available, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked harder
to become a keyboard-shortcuts person.  With the latest version of IntelliJ, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the tiny icons I use to get to
the settings window, something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot as I set up the new IDE instance on the new laptop.  So I bit
the bullet and learnt the keyboard shortcuts, and it&amp;rsquo;s already saving me a bunch of time (on the rare occasions when the
aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Navigate to Action&amp;rdquo; fails me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ctrl+Alt+S for the settings dialog (appears to be Cmd + , on the Mac)
Shift+Ctrl+Alt+S for the project structure dialog (appears to be Cmd + ; on the Mac)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij/settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34; title=&#34;Settings Shortcuts&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t already using those either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;selecting-the-negative&#34;&gt;Selecting the negative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use completion/suggestions all the time from IntelliJ, I&amp;rsquo;m far too lazy to type everything.  What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise, is
that you don&amp;rsquo;t just have to accept the default they give you.  If, for example, IntelliJ suggests a boolean value, you
can get it to negate that value by selecting it with &amp;ldquo;!&amp;rdquo; instead of enter or tab.  Yes, I know I&amp;rsquo;ve done a horrible job
of explaining that, but take a look at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-5.Negatingcompletion&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;
and try it, it&amp;rsquo;s quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exclude-from-autocomplete&#34;&gt;Exclude from Autocomplete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of code completion, sometimes IntelliJ is sometimes just a bit too keen to suggest something, and you really
will never want that value.  In the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used &lt;code&gt;Settings -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; General -&amp;gt; Auto Import&lt;/code&gt; to manage the
suggestions (the most common one for me is I will never want &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;, I will almost always want
&lt;code&gt;java.util.List&lt;/code&gt;).  Well, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into settings to do this, you can
&lt;a href=&#34;https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Code+Completion#CodeCompletion-9.Excludefromcompletion&#34;&gt;do it from the suggestions themselves&lt;/a&gt; -
navigate to the item you don&amp;rsquo;t want (in my case, &lt;code&gt;java.awt.List&lt;/code&gt;) and press Alt+Enter, this will give you the option
of excluding this from the suggestions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s what I found from just one day of browsing the documentation and setting up my IDE from scratch yet again.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll promptly forget all these, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll be new weapons in my armoury of IDE-fu. Either way, maybe one or
two people will find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.javaadvent.com/2014/12/developers-want-to-be-heard.html&#34;&gt;piece for the Java Advent Blog&lt;/a&gt;,
about how developers aren&amp;rsquo;t just communing with the computer, they also need to feel listened to by real human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New Year, New Adventures</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/new_year_new_adventures/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Just over two years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/and_for_my_next_trick/&#34;&gt;I embarked upon a journey&lt;/a&gt; as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then
called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/&#34;&gt;MongoDB Inc&lt;/a&gt;). My goals for
this role were: to learn what it was
like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to
level up my advocacy skills.  I have met all these goals, and more - I met some fantastic people; learnt different approaches to
software development; discovered my new favourite database for creating applications; moved to Spain; started both a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/&#34;&gt;MUG&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;;
worked to understand the value of community and evangelism, and to help create a strategy for these areas;
and my evangelism efforts and open source work earned me the &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.net/website/java-champions/bios.html#Gee&#34;&gt;Java Champion&lt;/a&gt; title.
I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud of what I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved over this period, and very grateful to MongoDB for giving me these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, a new adventure is about to begin.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve seen my &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt;
this year, you&amp;rsquo;ll know of my love affair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;,
a tool I use daily (even for blogging). Well, now I&amp;rsquo;m joining the team at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jetbrains.com/&#34;&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;,
where I&amp;rsquo;m going Full Advocate. I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; this means I get to carry on doing more of what I love - presenting, writing,
and working on demos to help developers become more productive. I hope this will give me opportunities to stay ahead of the curve in the
Java/JVM world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, in answer to the Most Frequently Asked Question, I am staying in Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with Sevilla and I&amp;rsquo;m not ready to
leave yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/Sevilla.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Cathedral&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall leave you with my somewhat disasterous &amp;ldquo;Top Ten IntelliJ Tips&amp;rdquo; from GOTO Aarhus, which is worth watching just to see Dan North
save me from the curse of the live demo.  Things can only get better from here, right?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically,
although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem,
only identify some issues and explore some options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&amp;rsquo;t post it now I&amp;rsquo;ll never post it, and it&amp;rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and
posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;firstly-what-stops-people-from-stepping-up-to-speak&#34;&gt;Firstly, what stops people from stepping up to speak?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the very first thing any developer says when you ask them why they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about presenting at conferences or user
groups. Turns out, you always have something to say.  For example, our most popular sessions at the Sevilla JUG and MUG are &amp;ldquo;Introduction
to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. You hear from plenty of experts who have travelled the whole road to some pinnacle of excellence,
but what many developers need is simply someone a couple of steps ahead of them to lead them forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always know more than &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know everything, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know more than everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should I be role model?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So many women feel this, and I&amp;rsquo;m completely sympathetic to this view point: I&amp;rsquo;m a woman developer, getting along, happy in my job,
happy being a programmer, why the hell should I have to stand up and present and blog and be a role model for other women? Men don&amp;rsquo;t have
to do that. Men can &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; be developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the fear that if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; stand up, become a role model, that somehow people will think you&amp;rsquo;re representing all
women developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll be worried because you can only represent who you are, what you do, you can&amp;rsquo;t represent a whole gender in a
single presentation or a single interview.  And the pressure! What if I mess up? What if I say something my gender does not agree with?
What if I say something that causes my whole gender to be judged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally understandable fears. Totally true that many people will ask you to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; woman developer, to answer for all women.  Well,
that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m asking more women to stand up, to be role models - if we all step up, it will no longer just be me, and you,
and that other one over there. There&amp;rsquo;ll be more of us, more differing voices, we&amp;rsquo;ll stand out less. But we have to stand up first.  And
in the meantime it&amp;rsquo;s us and our points of view they&amp;rsquo;re listening to. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you rather voice your opinion than have someone else speak
on your behalf? Especially when very few people really can represent you, who you are and what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t answer the questions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised at what you do know, so people who present run into this less than you&amp;rsquo;d think, even if you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning,
but just in case here are some tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the question, paraphrasing. Firstly, this ensures you&amp;rsquo;ve actually heard the question correctly. Secondly,
it allows the whole audience to hear it, and thirdly, but most importantly, it buys you time to think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest - say you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and move on. If you know somewhere that might have the answer,
point the person to that resource.  But a technical audience actually values the answer &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; more than you think. Especially
the person who asked the question, it makes them feel really smart!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know, but you think the audience might know, throw it back to them. Either to the person who asked the question,
if that feels appropriate (especially if this is one of those &amp;ldquo;look how smart I am&amp;rdquo; questions),
or to the audience as a whole. In conferences in particular, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance someone there knows the answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re genuinely terrified of all questions, say at the start of the presentation that you won&amp;rsquo;t take questions in the talk. Offer
an alternative, like via Twitter or e-mail, if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-conference-organisers-do&#34;&gt;What can conference organisers do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specifically invite the people you want presenting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Don&amp;rsquo;t just wait for them to submit. If you want more women, more diversity, invite them. And invite them early&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your women presenters early.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Recognise that there are relatively few women presenters on &amp;ldquo;the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and understand that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants them to speak at their
conference. This rare breed, the female technical presenter, gets booked up &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; in advance.  They&amp;rsquo;re probably as in-demand as your
keynote speakers, and can probably devote less time to appearing at conferences than those who have made it to keynote-standard (I&amp;rsquo;m
making a sweeping generalisation that your techy women have day-jobs as developers and your keynote speakers are either professional
presenters or at least can argue presenting as a critical part of their job).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you have a limited resource (experienced women presenters) that&amp;rsquo;s in high demand. You need to reach out directly to them,
invite them, and secure them well in advance of your conference.  Many big conferences, for example JavaOne and QCon,
will invite speakers six months in advance. If you give women speakers a month&amp;rsquo;s notice before your conference or event,
they simply are not going to have the space in their schedule at that late notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showcase your diversity on your website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory&#34;&gt;microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;,
go and read what that means before you get any further.  There&amp;rsquo;s a very simple thing you
need to do with your website, whether you&amp;rsquo;ve opened for CFP or you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get attendees to register - make sure the photos on your
website show the type of diversity you want to encourage.  Only yesterday I was looking at the website of a big conference,
who I know for a fact are working &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to ensure diversity, not just with gender but race, age,
and where possible in less physically obvious dimensions. The conference is many months off, so the only photo they have on the website
is a background photo of the exhibition hall from some previous year, crammed full of attendees - white, male attendees,
as far as it&amp;rsquo;s possible to tell.  It&amp;rsquo;s extremely subtle. You might not even notice, as the photo is behind the headers and text of the
site. But I noticed. And you can be sure the subconscious of every person who went to the website to either submit a proposal for a
talk, or is considering asking their employer to pay for the registration, also noticed.  The conscious mind might be able to shrug it
off.  But the subconscious of a non-white and/or non-male person notices and plants the subtle seed
of &amp;ldquo;this conference is not for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, conference and event organisers - if you want more women applying to speak at your conference,
show more women on your website.  If you want a more diverse audience, show more diverse faces.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve invited your women presenters
early and secured them early, show their photos on the site - this sends a strong message to other women that their talk proposals will be
taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run warm up nights to try out new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know conference organisers get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of submissions, and I know it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell which are going to be good speakers,
especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new speakers or don&amp;rsquo;t have a video.  If you&amp;rsquo;re genuine about improving the diversity of your speakers,
run free nights to a) promote your conference and b) try out new speakers.  Probably a good idea to have a new speaker and a known
speaker to attract the crowd and give newbies a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so damn picky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New speakers need to be encouraged. Find a way to see their content without just discarding an unknown name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing speakers might not have the luxury of creating new content. Many conferences want genuine practitioners,
not just evangelists, but those people have day jobs and can&amp;rsquo;t be creating a new talk just for your conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave space for new speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;and don&amp;rsquo;t just have 7 slots for a pro speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at your swag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Not just guys t-shirts.  One conference gave out cupcakes for example. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be handbags and high-heeled shoes,
just take a quick look and see if your swag is generally useful for techies, or if it leans towards men only. Men only swag (men&amp;rsquo;s
t-shirts, bottle openers, subtle things like that) subliminally says &amp;ldquo;you don&amp;rsquo;t belong here&amp;rdquo; to the women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give feedback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell every individual why they were rejected, but you could look at all the rejected submissions and give broad indications of
the type of CFPs that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. Maybe write a blog post explaining which sorts of talks didn&amp;rsquo;t make it and why.  This will help
speakers create content that better fits your conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be specific about what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you have tracks you&amp;rsquo;re finding content for, put them on the website/CFP, so people know what the topics are. If you have an
idea that you want 30% beginner material and 30% very advanced, make that clear too. Especially if you want &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; beginner or &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
advanced. People will submit more appropriate talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a beginner&amp;rsquo;s track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;not just for the speakers, for the content too. Beginner speakers may be more comfortable presenting &amp;ldquo;Introduction to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; talks.&lt;br&gt;
Having a beginners track, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for content or speakers, will make newbies feel more included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-other-things-can-we-try&#34;&gt;What other things can we try?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User groups can grow talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice writing CFPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presentation skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning talks, book club, different meetup styles (like fishbowl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an open conference to encourage new speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&amp;rsquo;s user groups are instrumental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So here&amp;rsquo;s something interesting. I&amp;rsquo;m sceptical of all-women user groups as I feel it separates us from the communities we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be
contributing to. But women&amp;rsquo;s user groups can help us to integrate better.  For example, Duchess France helped and encouraged its members
to submit talks to Devoxx, gave feedback on CFPs before they were submitted, and provided a safe place for the women to practice
presenting beforehand.  I think this is exactly the sort of thing women&amp;rsquo;s user groups could be fantastic for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advice-for-budding-speakers&#34;&gt;Advice for budding speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just Do It&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you do it, the more comfortable you&amp;rsquo;ll be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker, it can make you feel less of an impostor at a conference - you&amp;rsquo;re not just a woman developer, you&amp;rsquo;re a speaker!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s afraid, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer wants to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience is on your side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start Small (user groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be technical. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be super smart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootstrapping is hard - you haven&amp;rsquo;t presented so you can&amp;rsquo;t get into conferences. Again, user groups can help with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair. Ask a more experienced presenter if you can co-present with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for mentors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo; is perfectly acceptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate there is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more I could have covered, and many topics deserve more depth. But this is the brain dump from the Devoxx
session, and maybe one day things will be expanded into their own topics.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>It&#39;s not waste, it&#39;s learning</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/its_not_waste_its_learning/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In one my my rare weekends at home, I found myself on a pottery course (this is the sort of thing that happens when you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; person).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34; title=&#34;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;OK, not pottery, horses. The course was on a farm.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time on the course, there was something enormously satisfactory and therapeutic about working with my hands,
on something creative that was for me, and only me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My first bowl&#34; title=&#34;My first bowl&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Honestly, I think the one I did in primary school when I was seven was better.   
And I don&#39;t care, because I loved creating it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really struck me that day was embracing failure and destruction as part of the creative process.  Let me give you a
couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher showed us several techniques for creating pottery, one of which was using plaster moulds and very liquid clay to produce more
complex items (for example, mugs and animal figures).  He told us that when using a new mould,
the first few items would be useless.  But these &amp;ldquo;failures&amp;rdquo; are an important process for the mould itself.  The
class was in Spanish, so my understanding was imperfect, but I think it was something to do with the fact that the plaster moulds are
supposed to absorb water, and therefore I assume at the beginning they absorb far too much and the clay ends up being too dry and brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34; title=&#34;Pottery created with moulds&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;Pottery created with moulds&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second example was when he showed us why it was so difficult to create a clay plate - bowls, mugs, cups were fine,
but a plate is difficult as it&amp;rsquo;s flat and the shape doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough structure for it to have any rigidity  if it&amp;rsquo;s even slightly damp
(and clay stays damp for a looong time, even in a climate like Seville&amp;rsquo;s). He demonstrated this by cutting straight through the plate
that he&amp;rsquo;d put into the mould earlier and folding it up, to the collective intake of breath of the whole class - a class of people of a range
of ages and backgrounds. We seem socially programmed to find destruction of any kind upsetting (which is probably, overall,
not a bad thing), when the teacher sliced the plate in half to demonstrate how floppy the plate was, we were all disturbed by this waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My pieces&#34; title=&#34;My pieces&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Even when I broke my bowl when preparing it for the kiln, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to abandon it - I turned it into a 
candle holder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing - it&amp;rsquo;s clay.  Clay is mud.  It&amp;rsquo;s from the ground.  Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s almost completely reusable.  All of the leftover
clay from our earlier exercises, all of the excess liquid clay from the moulds, all of the pieces that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it,
it was put aside and saved for later.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a waste.  It&amp;rsquo;s learning.  It&amp;rsquo;s experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking.  If we can be like that about something concrete, something that exists in the real world,
why aren&amp;rsquo;t we like that about something as ephemeral as code?  Why are we so afraid to throw away code? And don&amp;rsquo;t tell me we&amp;rsquo;re not
afraid - how many &amp;ldquo;spikes&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;prototypes&amp;rdquo; have you seen running in production?  Have you read people talking about
creating code and throwing it away, and thought &amp;ldquo;that sounds nice, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to just producing useful code&amp;rdquo;? (Note: I&amp;rsquo;m not
talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html&#34;&gt;throwing away perfectly good production code&lt;/a&gt;,
nor am I talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://codesqueeze.com/refactorbation/&#34;&gt;refactorbation&lt;/a&gt;, a term I just discovered and love.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking about creating for research, spikes, learning etc, and then throwing it away).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/its_not_waste_its_learning/pottery-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Java&#34; title=&#34;Java&#34; height=&#34;300&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;What?? I needed to carve something into the medallion&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477800670/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1477800670&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=5KXFITDLKQQCXD3K&#34;&gt;Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1477800670&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;,
and there&amp;rsquo;s a section in there that talks about getting into the habit of
creating just for the sake of creating.  Not for your side projects, not for a client, not even for your portfolio.  Simply to get into
the habit of creating.  &lt;em&gt;Maybe&lt;/em&gt; some of those ideas, or processes, will come in handy later down the line.  Or maybe,
like the clay moulds, simply creating something for throwing away actually helps the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These experiences have left me with a feeling that I should start getting used to the idea of throwing code away,
and start creating things for no reason other than the feeling of creating.  It could be like running - in theory I run so I have to
worry less about my weight and my fitness, but actually I run &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more frequently when I run just for the joy of running. The fitness
and health are side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re so reluctant to throw code away precisely because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; ephemeral.  Maybe with the clay,
we can see that concrete thing, that mud, being turned into something useful eventually.  With running,
you can feel the difference in your attitude, in your fitness, maybe see it on the scales. With code, when you delete those characters,
revert that change, you feel like you lost something, and have nothing to show for that precious time.  When actually you created new
pathways in your brain, added new memories and learnt new lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m ready yet to create just for the sake of creating, I think I&amp;rsquo;m just too results-driven. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to
write about it here to remind myself that it is something I want to do. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the exercise, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The final pieces, still needing the kiln to finish the glaze.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</description>

            <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWKf3ROVgrY?list=PLEx5khR4g7PIIBNcNhHOMmOhzxcwI5joG&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/41120693&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented a shorter, more succinct version of this talk at &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/139726208&#34;&gt;The Lead Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the talk I show an example of how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/a3e4a54329e94ada2fe2&#34;&gt;implement lambdas&lt;/a&gt;,
and I also demonstrate a very crude performance test for using &lt;code&gt;parallelStream&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to link to the performance test as it&amp;rsquo;s
not a shining example of how to write these sorts of tests, but if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find it in my Github repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also talk about how amazing Spock is, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested you can read more about
&lt;a href=&#34;http://trishagee.github.io/tags/spock/&#34;&gt;my experiences with Spock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk was built off an &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/&#34;&gt;earlier blog post&lt;/a&gt; I wrote, about how to decide which technologies to
invest your personal time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: The talk has been updated for 2016 and the Agile aspects emphasised in a version presented at Agile Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Fp4LPkfAGcL8FF&#34; width=&#34;595&#34; height=&#34;485&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/trishagee/staying-ahead-of-the-curve-62186557&#34; title=&#34;Staying Ahead of the Curve&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Staying Ahead of the Curve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//www.slideshare.net/trishagee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trisha Gee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this crude decision
chart and the mind-map of potential ways to play with a technology. Remember, learning to say &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; to a technology can be very powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of writing a book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://leanpub.com/careeradviceforprogrammers/&#34;&gt;Career Advice for Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re
interested, let me know (because, you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of spare time for another project, sigh&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;presentation-abstract&#34;&gt;Presentation Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all want to stay ahead of the curve - after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what you go to a conference for. But have you ever considered how being ahead
of the curve might be dangerous?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using a new language before you understand it, putting a technology into production so you can learn it,
abandoning &amp;ldquo;old practices&amp;rdquo; before you&amp;rsquo;ve got the benefit from them… These things are common practice,
under the guise of Progress and Keeping Up To Date.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But while we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be running around like headless chickens chasing the next Shiny New Thing,
we do need to see to our Continuous Learning and, of course, we should Embrace Change.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we balance these two extremes? And how do we see to our own growth and learning as techies while meeting the needs of our
project, team and organisation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>MongoDB London</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/mongodb_london/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TL;DR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt;, 6th November, 50% off with discount code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is nearly upon us again,
and I&amp;rsquo;m dead disappointed I can&amp;rsquo;t make it this year (I&amp;rsquo;m
[keynoting at GOTO Berlin] (&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&lt;/a&gt;) instead,
which I&amp;rsquo;m terrified, I mean, excited, about). The last MongoDB London was really interesting for me - I was fairly new to the company,
I&amp;rsquo;d been here less than six months, and it was a really great way to go both broad and deep on the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to find a blog post where I talked about my experiences, but it looks like I only wrote that In My Mind. In fact,
I only only wrote two whole lines of notes on the conference.  But 18 months later I clearly remember presentations from my colleagues
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rosslawley.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Ross&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://derickrethans.nl/&#34;&gt;Derick&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the geo capabilities in MongoDB,
presentations which heavily influenced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/&#34;&gt;live coding demo&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving
recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also remember Eliot&amp;rsquo;s presentation - Eliot is one of those people who totally gets away with breaking the &amp;ldquo;speak in a measured,
clear fashion&amp;rdquo; presenters rule, he fires fascinating information at you at high speed and it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the compelling things
about his talks. If you ever get a chance to see him talk about the product, it&amp;rsquo;s totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, the most awesome thing about the conference was the chance to meet, and talk to,
a bunch of different MongoDB people - there are the engineers who work on the product (like me and my colleagues);
the people leading the way with the technology, like Eliot; and finally, but for me most importantly,
you get to meet really interesting people who are using MongoDB in ways that you might not even imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway the point of this sales pitch is, whether you&amp;rsquo;re using MongoDB already or you&amp;rsquo;re keen to find out about it,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.com/events/mongodb-london-2014&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt; is only going to take a day from your life,
and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a bunch of interesting things. And, with a Special Discount Code from me,
it&amp;rsquo;s only £45! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mongodb-london-2014-registration-13140209721&#34;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;50Trisha&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>AngularJS, HTML5, Groovy, Java and MongoDB All Together - What Could Possibly Go Wrong??</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/angularjs_html5_groovy_java_mongodb_wcpgw/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant,
mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example,
where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact code I present has changed a bit over time, the session I did for hack.summit() is the most recent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/VyEdy-l5608&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  You&amp;rsquo;ll see there are a number of different branches for the
different versions I&amp;rsquo;ve presented. The current one is the NoSQL Matters version.  With all the branches,
the commits correspond to the user stories in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/i-want-coffeejavaone&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt;,
so you can get a feel for how the code builds up throughout the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also presented the talk as a series of &lt;a href=&#34;http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=/zztT3fScng&amp;offerid=145238.10000553&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&#34;&gt;short, follow-along lessons&lt;/a&gt;. You can get 40% off the price with discount code VDEAL40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=/zztT3fScng&amp;offerid=145238.10000553&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;IMG border=0 src=&#34;http://www.informit.com/ShowCover.aspx?isbn=9780134070865&amp;type=d&#34; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the demo I don&amp;rsquo;t get much of a chance to go through the Groovy script I use to import data into MongoDB,
so I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/groovy_import_to_mongodb/&#34;&gt;whole blog post just on that subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk has been videoed several times -
some older versions use a different library to talk to MongoDB and (I hope) you&amp;rsquo;ll see that the most recent code is even simpler than
these initial demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parleys.com/talk/html5-angularjs-groovy-java-mongodb-together-what-could-possibly-go-wrong&#34;&gt;JavaOne, October 2014&lt;/a&gt; (uses Morphia, but the Java driver for &lt;code&gt;getNearest&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRrSAkEAnZQ&#34;&gt;vJUG, September 2014&lt;/a&gt; (the Java back end is similar to the JavaOne version, but UI for getting the nearest coffee shop is slightly different)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/content/2015/05/15-html5-angularjs-groovy-java-mongodb-all-together?cmp=tw-prog-na-article-os15_1431727268&#34;&gt;OSCON, July 2014&lt;/a&gt; (uses Morphia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/interview_at_goto_chicago/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago, May 2014&lt;/a&gt; (there&amp;rsquo;s an interview where I explain the motivation behind the
presentation, and the video uses MongoJack instead of Morphia &amp;amp; shows an even earlier version of the find-my-coffee UI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/demo-java-javascript-mongodb&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding, March 2014&lt;/a&gt; (only the second time I presented this
demo, shows the initial technology stack (including MongoJack) and UI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>Using Groovy to import XML into MongoDB</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/groovy_import_to_mongodb/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/groovy_import_to_mongodb/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been demonstrating how easy it is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRrSAkEAnZQ&#34;&gt;create modern web apps using AngularJS,
Java and MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.  I also use Groovy during this demo to do the sorts of things Groovy is
really good at - writing descriptive tests, and creating scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the time pressures in the demo, I never really get a chance to go into the details of the script I use,
so the aim of this long-overdue blog post is to go over this Groovy script in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I want to clarify that this is not my original work - I &lt;strike&gt;stole&lt;/strike&gt; borrowed most of the ideas for the demo from my
colleague Ross Lawley. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://rosslawley.co.uk/posts/the-most-popular-pub-name/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; he goes into detail of how he built
up an application that
finds the most popular pub names in the UK.  There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://rosslawley.co.uk/posts/the-most-popular-pub-name/#toc_1&#34;&gt;section in there&lt;/a&gt;
where he talks about downloading the open street map data and using python to convert the XML into something more MongoDB-friendly - it&amp;rsquo;s
this process that I basically stole, re-worked for coffee shops, and re-wrote for the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming if you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Java for any period of time, there has come a moment where you needed to use it to parse XML. Since my
demo is supposed to be all about how easy it is to work with Java, I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want to do this. When I wrote the demo I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really all
that familiar with Groovy, but what I did know was that it has built in support for parsing and manipulating XML,
which is exactly what I wanted to do. In addition, creating &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/Collections#Collections-Mapsmaps&#34;&gt;Maps&lt;/a&gt; (the
data structures, not the geographical ones) with Groovy is really easy, and this is effectively what we need to insert into
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goal-of-the-script&#34;&gt;Goal of the Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse an XML file containing open street map data of all coffee shops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract latitude and longitude XML attributes and transform into
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-geojson&#34;&gt;MongoDB GeoJSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform some basic validation on the coffee shop data from the XML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert into MongoDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure MongoDB knows this contains query-able geolocation data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito/blob/java-one/src/main/scripts/PopulateDatabase.groovy&#34;&gt;PopulateDatabase.groovy&lt;/a&gt;,
that link will take you to the version I presented at JavaOne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript.png&#34; alt=&#34;PopulateDatabase.groovy&#34; title=&#34;PopulateDatabase.groovy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;firstly-we-need-data&#34;&gt;Firstly, we need data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the same service Ross used in his blog post to obtain the XML file containing &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; coffee shops around the world. Now,
the open street map data is somewhat&amp;hellip; raw and unstructured (which is why MongoDB is such a great tool for storing it),
so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I really have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the coffee shops, but I obtained enough data for an interesting demo using&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.overpass-api.de/api/xapi?*[amenity=cafe][cuisine=coffee_shop]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito/blob/master/src/main/scripts/resources/all-coffee-shops.xml&#34;&gt;resulting XML file&lt;/a&gt; is in the
github project, but if you try this yourself you might (in fact, probably will) get different results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each XML record looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;node id=&amp;quot;178821166&amp;quot; lat=&amp;quot;40.4167226&amp;quot; lon=&amp;quot;-3.7069112&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tag k=&amp;quot;amenity&amp;quot; v=&amp;quot;cafe&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tag k=&amp;quot;cuisine&amp;quot; v=&amp;quot;coffee_shop&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tag k=&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; v=&amp;quot;Chocolatería San Ginés&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tag k=&amp;quot;wheelchair&amp;quot; v=&amp;quot;limited&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;tag k=&amp;quot;wikipedia&amp;quot; v=&amp;quot;es:Chocolatería San Ginés&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/node&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each coffee shop has a unique identifier and a latitude and longitude as attributes of a &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; element.  Within this node is a series
of &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; elements, all with &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; attributes. Each coffee shop has a varying number of these attributes,
and they are not consistent from shop to shop (other than &lt;code&gt;amenity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cuisine&lt;/code&gt; which we used to select this data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initialisation&#34;&gt;Initialisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Script Initialisation&#34; title=&#34;Script Initialisation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything else we want to prepare the database.  The assumption of this script is that either the
collection we want to store the coffee shops in is empty, or full of stale data.  So we&amp;rsquo;re going to use the [MongoDB Java Driver]
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&lt;/a&gt;) to get the collection that we&amp;rsquo;re interested in, and then drop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s two interesting things to note here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Groovy script is simply using the basic Java driver.  Groovy can talk quite happily to vanilla Java,
it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to use a Groovy library.  There are Groovy-specific libraries for talking to MongoDB (e.g. the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://grails.org/plugin/mongodb&#34;&gt;MongoDB GORM Plugin&lt;/a&gt;), but the Java driver works perfectly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to create &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-database&#34;&gt;databases&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/glossary/#term-collection&#34;&gt;collections&lt;/a&gt; (collections are
a bit like tables, but less structured) explicitly in MongoDB.  You simply use the database and collection you&amp;rsquo;re interested in,
and if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist, the server will create them for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we&amp;rsquo;re just using the default constructor for the &lt;code&gt;MongoClient&lt;/code&gt;, the class that represents the connection to the database
server(s).  This default is localhost:27017, which is where I happen to be running the database.  However you can specify your own
address and port - for more details on this see &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/94065240033/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-java-part-i&#34;&gt;Getting Started With MongoDB and Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;turn-the-xml-into-something-mongodb-shaped&#34;&gt;Turn the XML into something MongoDB-shaped&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Parse &amp; Transform XML&#34; title=&#34;Parse &amp;amp; Transform XML&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next we&amp;rsquo;re going to use Groovy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/api/groovy/util/XmlSlurper.html&#34;&gt;XmlSlurper&lt;/a&gt; to read the open street map
XML data that we talked about earlier.  To iterate over every node we use: &lt;code&gt;xmlSlurper.node.each&lt;/code&gt;.  For those of you who are new to
Groovy or new to Java 8, you might notice this is using a closure to define the behaviour to apply for every &amp;ldquo;node&amp;rdquo; element in the XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-geojson&#34;&gt;Create GeoJSON&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Create GeoJSON&#34; title=&#34;Create GeoJSON&#34;&gt;
Since MongoDB documents are effectively just maps of key-value pairs, we&amp;rsquo;re going to create a Map &lt;code&gt;coffeeShop&lt;/code&gt; that contains the
document structure that represents the coffee shop that we want to save into the database.  Firstly,
we initialise this map with the attributes of the &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;. Remember these attributes are something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;node id=&amp;quot;18464077&amp;quot; lat=&amp;quot;-33.8911183&amp;quot; lon=&amp;quot;151.1958773&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to save the ID as a value for a new field called &lt;code&gt;openStreetMapId&lt;/code&gt;. We need to do something a bit more
complicated with the latitude and longitude, since we need to store them as GeoJSON, which looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{ &#39;location&#39; : { &#39;coordinates&#39;: [&amp;lt;longitude&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;latitude&amp;gt;],
                 &#39;type&#39;       : &#39;Point&#39; } }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lines 12-14 you can see that we create a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; that looks like the GeoJSON, pulling the &lt;code&gt;lat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lon&lt;/code&gt; attributes into the appropriate
places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;insert-remaining-fields&#34;&gt;Insert Remaining Fields&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Insert Remaining Fields&#34; title=&#34;Insert Remaining Fields&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Validate Field Name&#34; title=&#34;Validate Field Name&#34;&gt;
Now for every &lt;code&gt;tag&lt;/code&gt; element in the XML, we get the &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; attribute and check if it&amp;rsquo;s a valid field name for MongoDB (it won&amp;rsquo;t let us
insert fields with a dot in, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want to override our carefully constructed &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; field). If so we simply add this key as the
field and its the matching &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; attribute as the value into the map. This effectively copies the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openstreetmap.org/&#34;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; key/value data into key/value pairs in the MongoDB document so we don&amp;rsquo;t lose any data,
but we also don&amp;rsquo;t do anything particularly interesting to transform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;save-into-mongodb&#34;&gt;Save Into MongoDB&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript6.png&#34; alt=&#34;Save Into MongoDB&#34; title=&#34;Save Into MongoDB&#34;&gt;
Finally, once we&amp;rsquo;ve created a simple &lt;code&gt;coffeeShop&lt;/code&gt; Map representing the document we want to save into MongoDB,
we insert it into MongoDB if the map has a field called &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.  We could have checked this when we were reading the XML and putting it
into the map, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually much easier just to use the pretty Groovy syntax to check for a key called &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;coffeeShop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we want to insert the Map we need to turn this into a &lt;code&gt;BasicDBObject&lt;/code&gt;, the Java Driver&amp;rsquo;s document type,
but this is easily done by calling the constructor that takes a Map.  Alternatively, there&amp;rsquo;s a Groovy syntax which would effectively do
the same thing, which you might prefer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;collection.insert(coffeeShop as BasicDBObject)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tell-mongodb-that-we-want-to-perform-geo-queries-on-this-data&#34;&gt;Tell MongoDB that we want to perform Geo queries on this data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/GroovyScript7.png&#34; alt=&#34;Add Geo Index&#34; title=&#34;Add Geo Index&#34;&gt;
Because we&amp;rsquo;re going to do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/query/nearSphere/&#34;&gt;nearSphere&lt;/a&gt; query on this data,
we need to add a &amp;ldquo;2dsphere&amp;rdquo; index on our location field. We created the &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; field as GeoJSON,
so all we need to do is call &lt;code&gt;createIndex&lt;/code&gt; for this field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s it!  Groovy is a nice tool for this sort of script-y thing - not only is it a scripting language,
but its built-in support for XML, really nice Map syntax and support for closures makes it the perfect tool for iterating over XML data
and transforming it into something that can be inserted into a MongoDB collection.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>JavaOne 2014, Day One</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_one_2014_day_one/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_one_2014_day_one/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m at JavaOne again, and after only one day I&amp;rsquo;ve already learnt stuff.  And, of course,
had a great time catching up with interesting people.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=10289&#34;&gt;Superpowered CI with Git - Sarah Goff-Dupont&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Continuous Integration we did at LMAX is quite different to what we do at MongoDB, and I was hoping to get some tips on better CI with
Git, especially given feature branches.  There was a good overview of development process using branch-per-feature,
and a comment that it&amp;rsquo;s nearly impossible to do &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; CI in this sort of environment.  But there was pragmatic advice on how to manage
the process and run automated builds in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take-home point for me is that I&amp;rsquo;m going to investigate &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks&#34;&gt;git hooks&lt;/a&gt; to try and
streamline our process and run some fast checks more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Sarah showed using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hipchat.com&#34;&gt;Hipchat&lt;/a&gt; in anger - I&amp;rsquo;ve now heard this mentioned enough that I&amp;rsquo;m going to look into it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2276&#34;&gt;Advanced Unit Testing with Spock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve [spoken before about Spock](&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/tags/spock/), and how much I love it.  The first section of this talk was a recap
of some of the basics, but the second part went on to some features I either previously ignored or wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of.  For example, in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/&#34;&gt;MongoDB Java Driver&lt;/a&gt;, we do use annotations to denote slower-running tests so we can select which environments to run in,
but we&amp;rsquo;re not using Spock annotations for this.  I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more we could do with both custom annotations like our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/3.0.x/util/src/main/category/Slow.java&#34;&gt;@Slow&lt;/a&gt; annotation,
Spock&amp;rsquo;s built in annotations like &lt;code&gt;@Issue&lt;/code&gt;, and some others which may not yet be in maven central like &lt;code&gt;@Requires&lt;/code&gt; for running
language-version tests ([e.g. Java 8 tests](&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kensipe/spock-javaone2014/blob/master/test/com/example/JavaLanguageSpec&#34;&gt;https://github.com/kensipe/spock-javaone2014/blob/master/test/com/example/JavaLanguageSpec&lt;/a&gt;
.groovy)) and &lt;code&gt;@IgnoreRest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also liked the example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kensipe/spock-javaone2014/blob/master/test/com/example/OldExampleSpec.groovy&#34;&gt;checking the new value against an old
value&lt;/a&gt;,
I can totally see this being useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other bits and pieces in this talk I&amp;rsquo;d like to dig into in more detail that I think will be very useful for the Java Driver.
But even more importantly, I learnt how to zoom into my screen so I can use that in my own presentation. Pro presentation top tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if you have even minor testing pains, it&amp;rsquo;s worth finding Ken&amp;rsquo;s talks on Spock, they&amp;rsquo;re great! And a source of inspiration for
better testing, as well as a sneaky way to understand why Groovy is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JCP Awards and Party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s not all work at these events.  For me, the highlight was the music at at the JCP Awards party.  Firstly,
we had an award-winning beat-box guy from the UK (sadly I don&amp;rsquo;t remember his name so I can&amp;rsquo;t link to his stuff).  An unusual choice for
an event like this, but it was a lot of fun. Then there was the live super-band, The Null Pointers, made up of JUG leaders from around the
world (including &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matkar&#34;&gt;@matkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/frankgreco&#34;&gt;@frankgreco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fguime&#34;&gt;@fguime&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit,
I was a little concerned about this idea, but the guys were fantastic, and it was a lot of fun singing along to Free&amp;rsquo;s Alright Now and
Radiohead&amp;rsquo;s Creep. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oracle.com/openworld/appreciation-event/index.html&#34;&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/a&gt; is going to have to work hard to compete with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;and a quick plug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1703&#34;&gt;main presentation is on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a keyword-tastic live demo of AngularJS, Java &amp;amp; MongoDB.  Something &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; goes wrong in
this presentation, so I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;http://doodle.com/fvrasw9vrpxyb9dm&#34;&gt;taking bets right now on what that will be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Getting Started with MongoDB and Java</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/getting_started_with_mongodb_and_java/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/getting_started_with_mongodb_and_java/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been missing an introduction to using MongoDB from Java for a little while now - there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of information in &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;the
documentation&lt;/a&gt;, but we were lacking a step-by-step guide to getting started as a Java
developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to rectify this with a couple of blog posts for the MongoDB official blog: the first, an introduction to using MongoDB from
Java, including a non-comprehensive list of some of the libraries you can use; the second, an introductory guide to simple CRUD
operations using the Java driver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/94065240033/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-java-part-i&#34;&gt;Getting Started with MongoDB and Java, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/94724924068/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-java-part-ii&#34;&gt;Getting Started with MongoDB and Java, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very much aimed at Java/JVM developers who are new to MongoDB, and want to get a feel for how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guides are for the current (2.x) driver. When we release 3.x, we&amp;rsquo;ll release updated guides as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>What could possibly go wrong? (GOTO Chicago)</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/interview_at_goto_chicago/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/interview_at_goto_chicago/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving,
which happens to be the same one I&amp;rsquo;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&amp;rsquo;m evolving it as I go along).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation leaves very little time for anything other than coding, as it&amp;rsquo;s quite challenging to create a full app in 50
minutes, so it was great to have the chance to talk about the motivations for the demo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZee7lRAUF4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video of the actual talk is also available now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmVnhyWqozA&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning it doesn&amp;rsquo;t clearly show the screen, but it does improve.  You can see an earlier version from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/demo-java-javascript-mongodb#anch110035&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; as well,
so if something&amp;rsquo;s not clear on one of the videos, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s better in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito/tree/goto-chicago&#34;&gt;code for the Chicago version is on Github&lt;/a&gt;,
and if you look through the history you can see how it builds up, the same as it does in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>...but most of all, it&#39;s fun</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/most_of_all_its_fun/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/most_of_all_its_fun/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I loved this analogy: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@nkkl/ride-like-a-girl-1d5524e25d3a&#34;&gt;Cycling is awfully similar to being a woman&lt;/a&gt;.
It nicely describes how it feels to be marginalised and not quite &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;. But there are some things that I&amp;rsquo;d like to
add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a cyclist is an enormous advantage, especially in gridlocked cities like London and New York,
because your maneuverability makes up for your lack of speed, and means you can skip queues and get to the front,
if you are assertive enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the bike lanes are badly designed, I share the main roads with other users.  I&amp;rsquo;m a road user,
I play by the rules, and in most cities I&amp;rsquo;m travelling only marginally slower than the cars. Just because the road wasn&amp;rsquo;t built for you
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you don&amp;rsquo;t have every right to use it.  And just because they made a crappy effort to include you doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to
go their route if it&amp;rsquo;s going to slow you down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/bad-bike-lane.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Who put a tree there?&#34; title=&#34;Who put a tree there?&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a thrill from being a bit outside of Their rules and not conforming to Their expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes it&amp;rsquo;s fraught with danger, but it&amp;rsquo;s a game. And it&amp;rsquo;s fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fascinated to read there have been
[zero fatalities in New York&amp;rsquo;s Citi Bike scheme](&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate&#34;&gt;http://www.slate&lt;/a&gt;
.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/30/nyc_citi_bike_zero_fatalities_in_new_york_city_bike_share_program_s_first.html).  Contrary to
expectations, opening up the city to masses of (often novice) cyclists has made road users more aware of them,
and forced the city to create infrastructure for them. Can we port this back across our analogy to being a woman?  What if we opened up
the advantages of being a woman to people who aren&amp;rsquo;t hardcore pioneers going it alone?  How would we do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_java8_launch_party/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_java8_launch_party/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night at the Sevilla JUG we officially celebrated the launch of &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/&#34;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt; - yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bt48HX7IQAAQBQq.jpg:large&#34; alt=&#34;Partay&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the picture, people had more fun than it looks.  Honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who missed the session, or who was there and wants access to the materials, here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/lambda-streams-java-8&#34;&gt;The Main Presentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/happy-mappy&#34;&gt;Trisha&amp;rsquo;s real-life lambda code&lt;/a&gt; (the class we were looking at was &lt;code&gt;TweetDecorator&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/SimonRitter/javase8-55thingsv2-sritter&#34;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; of another of Simon&amp;rsquo;s
presentations, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtAredKhyac&#34;&gt;55 New Features in Java SE 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

which is a great source of presentations from international speakers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Readable, Succinct, or Just Plain Short?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/short_vs_readable.md/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/short_vs_readable.md/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Which is more readable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version.substring(0, version.indexOf(&#39;-SNAPSHOT&#39;))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version[0..-10]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a value of &lt;code&gt;0.109-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;, they both give the same result.  And I&amp;rsquo;m tempted by the second,
because it&amp;rsquo;s shorter.  But I&amp;rsquo;m going to go with the first one - not because it&amp;rsquo;s more Java-ish and I&amp;rsquo;m scared of Groovy syntax,
but because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to understand if/when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: if &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t conform to the expected pattern, the two code fragments fail in two different ways.  If &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;
doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain &lt;code&gt;-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt;, the first will fail with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whereas the second will either arbitrarily slice the last 9 characters off the end of whatever the String does contain,
or if it&amp;rsquo;s too short you&amp;rsquo;ll get something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Negative array index [-10] too large for array size 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you, the developer, see this error (or notice your mangled version number) and look at the failing line of code,
you&amp;rsquo;ll have two different experiences.  When looking at the second example, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t write it in the first place or if you have a
memory as shocking as mine, you won&amp;rsquo;t get any clues from that code as to what the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; is - you&amp;rsquo;ll see what it does (chop the last
9 characters off the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; string), but not why.  You can &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the problem by adding an arbitrary 9 characters onto your &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the first example, however, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the intent right there - it&amp;rsquo;s trying to chop the string &lt;code&gt;-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; (and any
characters that might happen to come after it) off the end of the &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; string.  With this line of code,
if you checked the value of &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; and saw it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the correct suffix, you&amp;rsquo;d have a good idea of what the problem is and how
to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a third way, that potentially keeps the descriptiveness (is that a word?) of the first solution and makes it a bit shorter and
Groovier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;releaseVersion = version[0..&amp;lt;version.indexOf(&#39;-SNAPSHOT&#39;)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the less-than sign plonked in there to make it work correctly, which I find a bit jarring,
but it does work.  It&amp;rsquo;s a little more succinct than the original Java syntax and retains the intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion: yes, shorter code is generally better (and often more readable).  But I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in sacrificing code that
expresses the intent in order to reduce the number of characters used.  We&amp;rsquo;re not living in a memory-poor world any more,
and code is meant to be read by humans as well as computers.  Let&amp;rsquo;s make our code easy to understand when it goes wrong,
not simply the shortest way to do something when the stars are all perfectly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>The Handover</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/the_handover/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/the_handover/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I walked into the kitchen to see how lunch was going and my boyfriend handed me a knife,
a part-chopped hard boiled egg and said &amp;ldquo;finish this, I need to have a shower&amp;rdquo;. As you do. Apparently there were two things that needed
doing - &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; needed finishing, and I needed to keep an eye on the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;paired&amp;rdquo; with him while we&amp;rsquo;ve made that salad before, and I can tell when a fish is burning.  How hard could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I finished chopping the egg and putting it into the salad, I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the last thing that needed to go into
the salad - when he said &amp;ldquo;finish this&amp;rdquo;, did he mean the whole salad, or just the egg chopping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This blog post will be vaguely about technology at some point.  Probably.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After searching for other eggs that might need to be added, and sifting through the salad to see what was already in there,
I was still unclear about whether it was &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done&#34;&gt;done&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; or not, so I
went to bother my boyfriend in the bathroom (this is not a euphemism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I told you there were only two things left to do&amp;rdquo; he said - it was so clear to him what the steps were to finish,
that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand that there might be hidden assumptions in his handover.  All he wanted was for me to finish chopping the
(only) egg.  Oh and mix it all up. Of course. When I checked if I was supposed to add the olive oil and the salt, the answer was &amp;ldquo;No,
I don&amp;rsquo;t trust you to do that&amp;rdquo; (he&amp;rsquo;s right - I&amp;rsquo;m English, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know you could put salt in a salad
and certainly have no idea about quantities of olive oil. My Spanish boyfriend is genetically wired to know this stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the unclear instructions (&amp;ldquo;keep an eye on the fish&amp;rdquo;, if taken literally, could result in me watching it burn - fortunately I knew it
was secret code for &amp;ldquo;remove it from the heat when it&amp;rsquo;s done&amp;rdquo;) we had a very nice lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/HandoverSalad.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Salmon &amp; Salad&#34; title=&#34;Salmon and Salad&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are parallels between this, and what I was struggling with last week (hurrah, we get to the tenuous analogy!).  I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying
to do my first release for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt;, the project I&amp;rsquo;m taking over
for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.  I know my colleague was working hard on an automated release script (one click releasing FTW),
and I know he invested a reasonable amount of time in automating the release process (this is code for &amp;ldquo;I had a bad feeling about this&amp;rdquo;).
I was going to be the first to try this out without his machine/settings/user. Yay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday night Justin gave me some tips of what was involved, finishing with &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;and then &lt;code&gt;.gradlew relase&lt;/code&gt; should just work&amp;rdquo;.  Simples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day One: I struggled with the nexus plugin and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Two: I woke up with one of those ideas that hit you in the night and fixed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I spent two days trying to work out why the Git plugin wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I realised that for the whole time I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been using the local version of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/evanchooly/github-release-gradle-plugin&#34;&gt;gradle release plugin&lt;/a&gt; like I thought,
but an older version. When I fixed that&amp;hellip; I spent half a day proving I still had the same issue as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I commented out the code that wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, hard coded a bunch of values and used an old script to upload the Javadoc (don&amp;rsquo;t
get me started on how long it took me to find how &lt;a href=&#34;http://maven.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt; was populating the release number,
nor do I want to express the pain I felt at having to install Maven after being in love with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; for the
last two years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia/releases/tag/r0.108&#34;&gt;release 0.108 of Morphia&lt;/a&gt; went live on Thursday night - huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, as a responsible human being, rather than high-fiving myself, cracking open a bottle of wine and knocking off for the
weekend, next I need to prepare the handover for the next person doing the release. Not least because it&amp;rsquo;s probably going to be me,
and my memory is shocking.  I have two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a wiki page with the steps needed, manual or automated, including all the local properties that need to be set up as we can&amp;rsquo;t
have some of these passwords floating around on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix the automated release so it really is one click / command&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, option 2 still needs documentation because of the local properties that are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want to do is crack open that wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the moral of the story is: handovers are hard.  And essential.  And worse, often the person doing the handing over is doing so
because they&amp;rsquo;re short on time and, for whatever reason, not responsible for the next phase of the project. Combine this lack of time with
all the assumptions and implicit knowledge in that person&amp;rsquo;s head, and the information being transferred is likely to be&amp;hellip; less than
optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the handover receiver is now responsible for something they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge of and they&amp;rsquo;re not even aware of assumptions or
unknown unknowns. If you&amp;rsquo;re handing over between departments or teams, they might not even have the right tools to find out how to
progress (Ops teams and testers don&amp;rsquo;t always have access to the code, for example, and if they did might not have the context to find it
useful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tools to help ease the pain of handovers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PairProgrammingMisconceptions.html&#34;&gt;Pairing&lt;/a&gt;. Pairing might seem expensive (two people at one
keyboard?? How will they type fast enough?), but the savings in handover time (and increase in your [Bus Factor](&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;
.org/wiki/Bus_factor)) make it completely worthwhile.  Pairing with The Boy in making salad meant at least I knew what the steps and
ingredients were, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know what stage we were at. At LMAX, we reduced a lot of our testing backlog by embedding the testers
in the development team, and pairing with them at the start and at the end of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UserStory.html&#34;&gt;user stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t do pairing, code reviews help. I was at least aware of our release plugin as I&amp;rsquo;d seen the original develop in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/&#34;&gt;Java
driver&lt;/a&gt;. If I&amp;rsquo;d been pairing or code reviewing on Morphia,
I would have been even more aware of what the steps were and what changes had been made for that project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, if good old fashioned talking isn&amp;rsquo;t your thing, documentation is a good start.  And everyone who uses the docs needs to be
able to update the documentation when they find something wrong, missing, confusing, or just want to annotate it with something useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these good practices, really what you want is to remove all possible areas of miscommunication. Computers are logical things,
so if you can write down an exact list of steps that need to be done in order to achieve something,
you might be able to, I dunno, write that in a script, or something. If you
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;linkId=M5DNVR42T66J63VO&#34;&gt;Automate All The Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0321601912&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have these messy,
complicated conversations with these messy, complicated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to try and fix my script. I&amp;rsquo;ve even thought of a way to not need local properties, so maybe next time (or the time after),
when I have to do a release I&amp;rsquo;ll only have to type a single command. It&amp;rsquo;ll be worth a week or two to implement this if it saves me a week
like the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, that wine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;_No boyfriends or colleagues were harmed in the making of this post._&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/nighthacking_jug_sevilla/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/&#34;&gt;Mr Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; came to Sevilla on his crazy European tour to show us Lego and Robots.  This was our largest turnout yet
for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend,
and the weekend before the spectacle that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville&#34;&gt;Semana
Santa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/I5rnDZGNJW8&#34;&gt;in Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the first event that we&amp;rsquo;ve had videoed (apologies for the horrible focus at times on the video,
I&amp;rsquo;m just learning and used to relying heavily on auto-focus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/q3OKs08X3oo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much to Stephen for visiting, and thank you to those who came, you&amp;rsquo;re making me re-think the idea of running events at
weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=21306622&#34;&gt;photos on Meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example,
by &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_to_make_your_cv_not_suck/&#34;&gt;creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck&lt;/a&gt;, and by &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/&#34;&gt;staying ahead of the curve&lt;/a&gt;),
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davethomas.net/&#34;&gt;Dave Thomas&lt;/a&gt; asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon
.com/video#36), a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short
time.  Dave seemed to like something in it though, as he gave me the opportunity to present the topic again at YOW last December,
and this time I think I managed to distill the important points into the (still ridiculously short) time allotted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/N_uvRol__U8&#34;&gt;See the video here&lt;/a&gt;,
and please give me any feedback you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognise there are many many more topics I could cover, so I&amp;rsquo;d better start making a list.  Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated you on my travel plans, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve had some more conferences confirmed,
I thought I would pass the information on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really lucky to have been selected for some great conferences this year.  I was asked to do a few more,
and it was genuinely painful to say no to everything, but it seems the laws of space and time cannot be broken,
and so I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to select a tiny subset of all the places I&amp;rsquo;d like to go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 May: [GOTO Chicago](&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/presentation/HTML5,%20Angular.js,%20Groovy,%20Java,&#34;&gt;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/presentation/HTML5,%20Angular.js,%20Groovy,%20Java,&lt;/a&gt;
%20MongoDB%20all%20together%20-%20what%20could%20possibly%20go%20wrong?) - I&amp;rsquo;m giving the same live coding presentation from QCon London,
although knowing me I expect there will be some tweaks, changes, additions, and maybe improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22-23 May: In New York City, since I&amp;rsquo;m more or less in the area.  Gimme a shout if you want to meet for a drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25-28 May: &lt;a href=&#34;http://speakerconf.com/&#34;&gt;SpeakerConf&lt;/a&gt; Barcelona.  And while I&amp;rsquo;m in the area&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;29 May: Barcelona JUG - &amp;ldquo;HTML5, Angular.js, Groovy, Java, MongoDB all together - what could possibly go wrong?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-5 June: New York City, probably (wait, am I going to be at home at all??)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;23 July: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/35444&#34;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; - live coding again!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28 Sep - 2 Oct: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/speakers/index.html#gee&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; woohoo!  I love having this opportunity to visit San
Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a couple of other events I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out the details for, but I think this is 2014 all booked up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/post/qcon_london_2014/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;, I was grabbed for an interview with InfoQ.  It&amp;rsquo;s always a pleasure to be interviewed by Charles,
I think he brings out the best in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the video &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-mongdo-java8#.U00BRMNMIC4.blogger&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the interview we refer to the first time we met, which, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/interviewed_for_infoq_at_qcon_london/&#34;&gt;you can also watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Converting Blogger to Markdown</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/atom-to-hugo/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/atom-to-hugo/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; happily for three years or so, since I migrated the blog from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.livejournal.com/&#34;&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; and
decided to actually invest some
time writing.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy with it because I just type stuff into Blogger and It Just Works.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy because I can use my Google
credentials to sign in.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy because now I can pretend my two &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/+TrishaGee/&#34;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; accounts exist for a purpose,
by getting Blogger to automatically share my content there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of things have been problematic for the whole time I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code looks like crap, no matter what you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pictures are awkwardly jammed in to the prose like a geek mingling at a Marketing event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to solve a number of ways, with custom CSS at a blog- and a post- level.  I was super happy when I
discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://gist.github.com&#34;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;, it gave me lovely content highlighting without all the nasty CSS.  It&amp;rsquo;s still not ideal in a
blogger world though,
as the gist doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear in your WYSIWYG editor, leading you to all sorts of tricks to try not to accidentally delete it. Also I was
too lazy to migrate old code over, so now my blog is a mish-mash of code styles, particular where I changed global CSS mulitple times,
leaving old code in a big fat mess.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lesson to be learned there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem, photos, I just gave up on. I decided I would end up wasting too much time trying to make the thing look pretty,
and I&amp;rsquo;d never get around to posting anything.  So my photos are always dropped randomly into the blogs - it&amp;rsquo;s better than a whole wall of
prose (probably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy overall, the main reason being I don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain anything, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about my web server going
down, I don&amp;rsquo;t have versions of a blog platform to maintain, patch, upgrade; I can Just Write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://spf13.com&#34;&gt;my boss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://christiankvalheim.com/&#34;&gt;my colleague&lt;/a&gt;  were both on at me to try &lt;a href=&#34;http://spf13.com/project/hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;,
a site generator created by my boss.  I was resistent because I do not want to maintain my own blog platform,
but then Christian explained how I can write my posts in &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;, use Hugo to generate the content,
and then host it &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. It sounded relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering a move to something that supports markdown for a while, for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These days I write at least half of my posts on the plane, so I use TextEdit to write the content,
and later paste this into blogger and add formatting.  It would be better if I could write markdown to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve always disliked wiki-type syntax for documentation, markdown is actually not despicable,
and lets me add simple formatting easily without getting in my way or breaking my flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent a few days playing with &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to see what it was, how it worked, and whether it was going to help me.  I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a
few observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hugo really is lightning fast&lt;/strong&gt;.  If I add a &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the appropriate place, and with the Hugo server running on my local machine
it will turn this into real HTML in (almost) less time than it takes for me to refresh the browser on the second monitor.  Edits to existing
files appear almost instantly, so I can write a post and preview it really easily.  It beats the hell out of blogger&amp;rsquo;s Preview feature,
which I always need to use if I&amp;rsquo;m doing anything other than posting simple prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s awesome to type my blog in IntelliJ&lt;/strong&gt;.  Do you find yourself trying to use IntelliJ shortcuts in other editors?  The two I
miss the most when I&amp;rsquo;m not in IntelliJ are Cmd+Y to delete a line, and Ctrl+Shift+J to bring the next line up.  Writing markdown in
IntelliJ with my usual shortcuts (and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown&#34;&gt;markdown plugin&lt;/a&gt;) is really easy and productive.
Plus, of course, you get IntelliJ&amp;rsquo;s ability to paste from any item in the clipboard history. And I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about those
random intervals when blogger tells me it hasn&amp;rsquo;t saved my content, and I have no idea if I will just lose hours of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I now own my own content&lt;/strong&gt;.  It never really occurred to me before that all the effort I&amp;rsquo;ve put into three years of regular blogging is
&lt;em&gt;out there&lt;/em&gt;, on some Google servers somewhere, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a copy of that material.  That&amp;rsquo;s dumb,
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect how seriously I take my writing.  Now I have that content here, on my laptop, and it&amp;rsquo;s also backed up in Github,
both as raw markdown and as generated HTML, and versioned.  Massive massive win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have more control over how things are rendered&lt;/strong&gt;, and I can customise the display much more.  This has drawbacks though too,
as it&amp;rsquo;s exactly this freedom-to-play that I worry will distract me from actual writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every project that&amp;rsquo;s worth trying, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely without pain.  I followed the (surprisingly excellent) &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/overview/introduction&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://j3ff.com/blog/building-a-site-with-hugo/&#34;&gt;these guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but I did run into some fiddly bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get my head around the difference between my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/trishagee.com&#34;&gt;Hugo project code&lt;/a&gt; and my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/trishagee.github.io&#34;&gt;actual site content&lt;/a&gt; to begin with: how to put them into
source control and how to get my site on github pages.  I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with two projects on github,
even though the generated code is technically a subtree of the Hugo project.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m happy with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure about the difference between tags, keywords, and topics, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest.  Maybe this is something I&amp;rsquo;ll grow into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really need to spend some time on the layout and design, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to simply rip off Steve&amp;rsquo;s original layout.  Plus there are
things I would like to have on the main page which are missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to convert my old content to the new format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final migration from old to new (incomplete)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the last point first, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet if I will take the plunge and do full redirection from Blogger to the new github pages
site (and redirect my domains too), for a while I&amp;rsquo;m going to run both in parallel and see how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the fourth point, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a tool for migrating Blogger blogs into markdown that didn&amp;rsquo;t require me to install some other tool
or language, and there was nothing that was specifically Hugo-shaped, so I surprised myself and did what every programmer would - I
wrote my own. Surprising because I&amp;rsquo;m not normally that sort of person - I like to use tools that other people have written,
I like things that Just Work, I spend all my time coding for my job so I can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to devote extra time to it.  But my recent
experiences with &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/&#34;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; had convinced me that I could write a simple Groovy parser that would take my exported blog (in Atom XML
format)
and turn it into a series of markdown files.  And I was right, I could.  So I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new github project,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/atom-to-hugo&#34;&gt;atom-to-hugo&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s very rough, but a) it works and b) it even has tests.  And documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s come over me lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a creative, coding machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the new way of working, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to take me a while to get used to it and decide if it&amp;rsquo;s the way
I want to go.  At the very least, I now have my Blogger content as something markdown-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a couple of things I miss about Blogger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually like the way it shows the blog archive on the right hand side, split into months and years.  I use that to motivate me to
blog more if a month looks kinda empty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While Google Analytics is definitely more powerful than the simple blogger analytics, I find them an easier way to get a quick insight
into whether people are reading the blog, and which paths they take to find it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think either of these are showstoppers, I should be able to work around both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Sevilla MUG March Madness</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_mug_march_madness/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_mug_march_madness/</guid>
            <description>&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JVIgox7nGXo/UyjIQYxtiSI/AAAAAAAANc4/JV3lj4xwcgk/w919-h689-no/IMG_20140318_193758.jpg&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Sevilla-MongoDB-User-Group/events/166679892/&#34;&gt;Last night&lt;/a&gt; the Sevilla MUG had our
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lczajkowski.com/2014/02/19/march-madness-comes-to-a-city-near-you/&#34;&gt;March Madness&lt;/a&gt; event.  This was our largest event yet,
with 36 people signed up.  Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month,
that&amp;rsquo;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main attraction - [Javier]
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JvrBaena&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/JvrBaena&lt;/a&gt;) gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at &lt;a href=&#34;http://es.socialbro.com/&#34;&gt;SocialBro&lt;/a&gt; after using
MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slides for my introduction to Replica Sets and Sharding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/32480708&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
 And the slides for the main attraction:
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
 &lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/32464459&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom:5px; font-size:small&#34;&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.slideshare
 .net/fjavierbaena/sevilla-mongo-developers-group-mongodb-cmo-aprendimos-que-la-culpa-era-nuestra&#34; title=&#34;Sevilla Mongo Developers Group
 - MongoDB: Cómo aprendimos que la culpa era nuestra&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cómo aprendimos que la culpa era nuestra&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/strong&gt;from&lt;strong&gt;
 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/fjavierbaena&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Francisco Javier Baena Ríos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event went really well, everyone seemed engaged, and our first talk in Spanish seemed to encourage more questions than normal.  We
were also in a new venue, and although I love the central location of our previous venue and the friendliness of the owners,
the menu of the new location seemed to be a massive win.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. My 4th QCon London.  That’s not bad.  And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/qcon-day-one.html&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and even 2007 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-initial-thoughts.html&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2007/03/qcon-todo-list-inspired-by-conference.html&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; - how cute was I? &amp;ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&amp;rdquo;)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?) minute and do a live coding session, something much more technical than my recent talks.  I’ll leave the details for a separate blog post though, when the video comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that stands out for me from Wednesday though was Damian Conway programming &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_Game_of_Life&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; in Klingon.  Yeah.  Just find the video and watch it, the man is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12947751623/player/f7e8167be5&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The Thursday keynote was inspiring too from a totally different point of view - Tim Lister of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY5A8X2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00DY5A8X2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00DY5A8X2&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; fame shared stories from his career, and I came away from that really happy I work as a technologist, but with an increased desire to learn off other amazing people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12966704755/player/7193594b96&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On Thursday I hosted the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/sets/72157641948363514/with/12970259753/&#34;&gt;Not Only Java&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; track - I’m on the programme committee for QCon, and this year we wanted to cover leading edge technologies (as always) but we didn’t want to slice things into strict technology silos [interruption: argh! the person in front of me nearly destroyed my laptop by suddenly moving their chair back! Why do people bother in economy on a morning flight?].  So I wanted the Java track to be more representative of what today’s Java programmers care about - for the programmers of course, but also because I know there are architects and team leads at QCon who might not realise how things have moved on with the language, and how much polyglot programming we do these days. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; kicked it off with a great history lesson on the progress (or occasionally,  lack of it) in Java.  He begged us to study and understand Set Theory, to use async design, to think of the users of our APIs, and, most of all, to design nice, clean code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Next up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EvaAndreasson&#34;&gt;Eva&lt;/a&gt; took us through the fundamentals of Garbage Collection - this might not seem like a cutting edge subject these days, but it’s one of the most misunderstood subjects for Java programmers.  Eva gave us a really great, understandable view of the different types of garbage collectors, how they work, and their pros and cons.  She left us with a call to arms to not simply let other people try and solve this problem, but to get stuck in and contribute ourselves, via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;333&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; msallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; oallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/qconpictures/12970531704/player/e2c2f63b43&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch was my nerve-wracking live coding session, putting together a full stack end-to-end web app using AngularJS, HTML5, Java and MongoDB.  It only went wrong twice, and people seemed to like it.  I’ll post the video in another blog post as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s publicly available.  Code is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/cafelito&#34;&gt;available on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;We’ve been playing with the open spaces idea at QCon.  The Java one only had a few people in it, but that gave everyone a chance to speak at least.  We covered Java 8 (the Good and the Bad); other JVM languages; and UIs for Java (Javascript or GWT?).  And I plugged the work the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; does in London, of course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;After this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bodil.org/&#34;&gt;Bodil&lt;/a&gt; blew me away creating a My Little Pony game using &lt;a href=&#34;https://rx.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;RX&lt;/a&gt; in the browser.  ‘Nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/speakjava&#34;&gt;Simon Ritter&lt;/a&gt; gave us a view of the Java 8  features most likely to impact the way Java developers think about software design - lambdas and streams.  I thought this was a really great introduction to the concepts if you haven’t seen them before, and with concrete examples that showed how we should be using them.  If you&amp;rsquo;re not already looking at lambdas and streams, you should be - even if you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be using Java 8 yet, it&amp;rsquo;s worth getting a heads up on how it&amp;rsquo;s going to impact our programming style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’m very pleased with the way the Java track turned out on the day - every speaker was first class, a wide range of topics was covered, and I, for one, learnt something in every presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;To finish off the day, Emma Langman gave an awesome keynote about how people are the messy bit of your system, and how they’re never rational and you shouldn’t expect them to be.  I also highly recommend this talk, especially if you’re a techy and you’ve found yourself in some sort of management or team lead position.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Sadly I couldn’t stay for day three of the conference, I had to fly off to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/the-joy-of-coding.html&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt; to re-give the live coding presentation there.  Because, if you’re going to do something terrifying and doomed to failure, you might as well do it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QCon is an expensive conference, especially compared to the developer-friendly prices of something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.co.uk/&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;, but for getting a big picture of where the industry is, of things you might be missing, for learning hard core technical skills and understanding the important of the fluffy-people-stuff, and finally for meeting a wide range of people from developers to CTOs, I think you&amp;rsquo;d be hard pushed to find something better in London.  IMHO (and remember, I did disclose I&amp;rsquo;m on the programme committee). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although it&amp;rsquo;s really hard work putting together the programme for a track like this, and although both times I&amp;rsquo;ve said I&amp;rsquo;m Never Doing It Again, when it goes this well it makes you want to do it all over again.  After a break.  A looong break.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’ve been running into &lt;a href=&#34;https://corporate.sky.com/&#34;&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt; a bunch this week - firstly I was invited to kick off their innovation tech talks series last Monday, then I kept meeting Sky people (that makes it sound like they’re aliens) at &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It seems Sky is keen to create/foster a culture of innovation, which is an ambitious goal for such a large company.&amp;nbsp; So I was given a very vague brief for Monday’s presentation (“Can you do something Mongo-ish, maybe a bit of performance and concurrency stuff, and talk about overall best practice?”) I gave them an early view of a presentation I’m working on titled something like “Why do we keep reinventing the wheel?” (anyone who saw me at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jfokus.se/&#34;&gt;JFokus&lt;/a&gt; might realise that I cunningly swapped out most of the body of the “What do you mean, backwards compatibility?” talk and tried out this topic instead).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4a4pY12N7xM/Ux2KVRwNLpI/AAAAAAAANRw/gVsUg08fwyU/s1600/TrishaSky.jpg&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: right;&#34;&gt;Picture courtesy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&#34;g-profile&#34; href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/111755189375322301397&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;+Russell Miles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was supposed to be a 20 minute intro talk (OK, so I clocked it at 40 minutes in rehearsal) with the rest of the time devoted to questions on any subject I know about, or even anything I have an opinion on.&amp;nbsp; Sounds dangerous, but means I can always move fast on the answers I don’t know in order to cover more ground - cunning, you see?&amp;nbsp; Actually, that sounds like it would be more fun if alcohol were involved.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; The talk bit of the session took up most of the time, because I had really good questions during the course of the presentation.&amp;nbsp; It’s nice to talk to a much smaller group (there were maybe 30ish people, giving up their free time after work, like an internal user group).&amp;nbsp; But I also had questions on remote working, on creating a culture that’s appealing for developers to come and work in, and on MongoDB.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I don’t know how many companies do things like this, or lunchtime brown bags, or something, but I think they’re a great idea.&amp;nbsp; This was a mix of people from different departments, different teams, working on different technologies.&amp;nbsp; It was a good way to get people from across the organisation talking with each other and sharing best practice between teams.&amp;nbsp; Many organisations have people working in their little silo, and we (MongoDB) often find ourselves introducing teams from within the same organisation to each other - there’s no other mechanism for one team to find out about the other.&amp;nbsp; I guess that’s what white-tower architects were supposed to be for - to know what everyone’s up to and make sure people are doing the “right” thing.&amp;nbsp; Given this doesn’t seem to work, what else can we do to share knowledge internally?&amp;nbsp; How else can we get the right people to meet each other?&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Web development has changed a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I used to be a web developer.  Sort of.  Some times I’ve been on the bleeding edge, and others… I remember using JavaScript to call back-end services with an XML payload before people were using the term AJAX, but I also remember working on an enterprise um… “classic”… JSP application only “recently” - in fact that was probably the last job where I did anything that looked like web development.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So this blog post is going to chart the progress of web development through my own experience.  Of course, this doesn’t by any means cover the whole spectrum, but I think my experience has been not unusual for a Java programming working through the noughties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Over the course of my career I moved further away from the UI, because certainly early on the money and status was in “back end”, whatever that means, and not “front end”.  Which is ridiculous, really, especially as back then you couldn’t really follow best practices and clean code and test first and all that awesome stuff when doing front end development because none of the browsers played by the rules and frankly if you got it working at all you were a bloody genius.  And that’s not even considering the fact that as a “front end” developer you should be thinking about actual real human beings who use your product, and actual real human beings are messy things and understanding them is not (we’re told) traditionally a domain that we developers are naturally proficient in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Anyway, I digress.  This was supposed to be a history lesson.  Or a nostalgia trip.  Or possibly Ranty Trish waving her walking stick in the air and shouting “You kids don’t know how good you’ve got it these days”.  If nothing else, I hope that it makes other “back end” developers like myself appreciate how much things have moved on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Let’s go back to the olden days, before I’d even graduated: picture a time before smart phones - before phones were even common (I was horribly mocked at university for being poncy enough to have a mobile), before we knew if all this work we were doing to combat the millennium bug was going to stop the end of the world.  I was doing my first summer internship at &lt;a href=&#34;http://corporate.ford.com/&#34;&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and a contractor from Logica (who don&amp;rsquo;t seem to exist any more??) told me that if I was messing around with web pages and HTML (my friends and I had geocities-and-equivalent sites) I should look at this JavaScript thing to make my pages “dynamic”.  I didn’t have to just use GIFs to bring my page to life, I could move stuff around on the page.  I think I wrote a “you are in a crowded room”-type adventure game, because my background was BASIC and that’s what you do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Actually I haven’t even mentioned that we were creating these websites to stay in touch with each other.  We’d discovered guest books, and used them to write comments and share stories since we’d all moved out of our home town to go to different universities.  Man, why didn’t I invent Facebook back then?  That’s what we needed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;A year later, I was back at Ford doing my &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_degree&#34;&gt;sandwich year-in-industry&lt;/a&gt;.  The first project I worked during this time was a web-based reporting tool that needed to dynamically display hierarchical data.  We chose JavaScript trees to render this data - my year of messing around with my website paid off, and I was able to use my “cutting edge” Javascript skills in a real production environment.  Yay?  The back end was CGI - I think I was writing in Perl, but don’t tell anyone that.  I was learning Java at university, but this was a new language and I don’t think Ford was using it yet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The next project was a very ambitious one - be the first car manufacturer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/11990/Ford-Vauxhall-cut-online-car-prices/?HAYILC=RELATED&#34;&gt;sell new cars on the web&lt;/a&gt;.  Ford was well ahead of their time - the millennium bug had not killed us all, but people were barely buying books online, never mind spending tens of thousands of pounds on a car they’d never driven.  But it wasn’t just ahead of its time from a business point of view, technically it was very advanced too - we used lots of “DHTML” (as we were now calling it), a new-fangled technology called ASP, and we were writing modular, reusable &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/com/default.mspx&#34;&gt;COM&lt;/a&gt;ponents.  We used XSLT to parse the XML from the COM objects, and the ASP figured out whether you were Netscape or Internet Explorer (Firefox wasn’t even a gleam in the inventor’s eye, and forget Chrome, I think we using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.altavista.com/&#34;&gt;Alta Vista&lt;/a&gt; (whaaaat? AltaVista got bought by Yahoo??) not some new-fangled search engine beginning with G) so it could use the right XSLT to turn the XML into HTML that was readable by the browser you were using.  My job was to get the DHTML pages rendering and animating correctly in both IE4 and Netscape 4.  That was a lot of fun for me, but also very challenging.  And imagine my shock when a few months later I tested the site from the university UNIX machines to find that Netscape rendered it completely differently under UNIX.  I learnt a lesson about how important it was to test on different platforms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;We had some smart Microsoft people helping us out with this project, and, because it was 2000 and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble&#34;&gt;dot com crash&lt;/a&gt; hadn’t happened just yet, we also had a lot of young, overpaid, overconfident contractors who believed anything was possible.  I learnt a lot during this time, not just about the technology, but also about different approaches to shaping your IT career.  And about how much you could earn before you were 25.  I was definitely going to be a programmer when I left university the next year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Yeah, so… I graduated in 2001.  If you were around then, you’ll remember that getting a job was a bit more difficult than I had anticipated, especially as these young, overpaid contractors were now desperately grabbing anything they could find.  But that’s a story for another day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I didn’t go back to Ford straight away, I’d “been there and done that”.  I worked on the website for &lt;a href=&#34;http://commonpurpose.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Common Purpose&lt;/a&gt;.  On the first day, they sat me down with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1861003625/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1861003625&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;a book on JSP and Servlets&lt;/a&gt;, and that was my reading material for the next few weeks.  If I’d been fresh out of university where we’d been doing Applets, and where I’d written a Swing app on the side for my Dad’s school, this would have been a big mindset change for me.  But having worked on the ASPs it wasn’t such a big shift.  I did, however, like how JSPs and servlets made the separation between the view and all-of-the-other-logic-stuff a bit clearer - back in ASP-land we’d settled on a convention of dealing with the form data from the previous page in the first part of the ASP, and rendering the new page in the second part.  To this day I still don’t know what we should have been doing instead.  But in JSP-land it only took me&amp;hellip; I dunno, about 6 months I think, to get the website up and running.  The most difficult section was &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20021001132257/http://www.commonpurpose.org.uk/home/apply-online.vdf&#34;&gt;registrations&lt;/a&gt;.  And yes, I was a graduate, and yes, I was new, but that was a good turnaround for a web application “in those days”.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;In my spare time I used what I’d learnt on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blews-ltb.co.uk/knot.asp&#34;&gt;the blews website&lt;/a&gt;.  I even had a section where people could log in and &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20050322033948/http://www.blews-ltb.co.uk/photographs/photo.jsp?section=20&#34;&gt;comment on photos&lt;/a&gt; - we had whole conversations on this website.  It was a way for me and my friends to stay in touch.  If I’d cracked the photo-uploading instead of it being a manual process for me, I would have invented Facebook.  If only I’d known….&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The work dried up and there was nothing else for a graduate in the early noughties, so I went back to Ford.  My first role back I picked the same technologies we’d been using before - XML, XSLT, only this time we were using JSPs instead of ASP.  Our project had a very tight budget and we’d worked out that using open source Java technologies and running the application on one of the many UNIX machines lying around the place was a lot cheaper than the Microsoft solution.  I think we were the first team in Ford Europe to pick Java at a time when the recommended approach was Microsoft.  We delivered on time and under budget, and Java was the way forward for the department from then on.  But on this project I met a guy who would impact my career probably more than he even realises, a guy I’d work with again later.  He told me that in Java we no longer used Vector by default, but ArrayList (whaaat? What’s an &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html&#34;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/a&gt;? I had no idea what the differences were between Java 1.1, which we’d learnt at university, and Java 1.2, which was now standard).  And questioned my choice of XML/XSL.  Although I’d been learning new technologies and growing, he was the one who made it clear to me that I needed to keep myself ahead of the curve with the technologies I was using, or planned to use, if I wanted to stay relevant and make my life easier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On the next project I worked with a genius guy who was definitely keeping ahead of the curve - he was using JavaScript to send small XML payloads to the server (which was coded in Java), and rendering the response in place on the page instead of reloading the whole thing.  Mind.  Blown.  I didn’t even hear the term &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)&#34;&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; until a year or more later.  We were fortunate in that this was once again an internal application, so we controlled the browser.  This was back in the days when you wanted your users to be on IE5, as this was the only browser that supported this functionality.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The next few projects/jobs I worked on were all more pedestrian variations on the JSP theme - first I learnt &lt;a href=&#34;https://struts.apache.org/release/1.3.x/userGuide/release-notes-1_1.html&#34;&gt;Struts&lt;/a&gt;, which at least made us realise there was a model, a view, and a controller.  Then at &lt;a href=&#34;http://web.archive.org/web/20050211061038/http://www.touchclarity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Touch Clarity&lt;/a&gt; I learnt about &lt;a href=&#34;https://spring.io/blog/2004/03/24/spring-framework-1-0-final-released&#34;&gt;Spring MVC&lt;/a&gt;, which actually put the validation errors next to the boxes which cause the error - by default, without you having to mess around.  Spring was a revelation too, a framework that really tried not to get in your way.  It was also frustrating because you needed to understand its lifecycle, but it did so much heavy lifting for you, it sped up standard CRUD-app web development enormously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;A couple of years passed, during which time I was still working on a web application (for an investment bank) but I can’t for the life of me remember what technologies we used (other than Java).  I know it was hard to test and I know the tricky stuff was “back end” not “front end”.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;In the next project where I had any control of the technology, I picked Spring since I’d had such a good experience previously.  It took 4 developers a couple of months or so to develop an admin application for a trading app.  Given the previous timescales I’d worked with, this seemed pretty good.  Until a few months later and two other guys on the project produced an admin app for our bank users in a matter of weeks.  I can’t remember what they used, maybe &lt;a href=&#34;http://grails.org/&#34;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt;?  But it was another demonstration of how I really should have been researching the field instead of simply sticking with what I knew, especially when I knew my knowledge was a couple of years out of date.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Fast forward to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;, and we were using &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit&#34;&gt;GWT&lt;/a&gt;, pre-2.0 - I think this probably feels natural if you’ve been a Swing or AWT developer, but I’m still not convinced it’s a sound web platform (although I know it has improved).  It was great because cross-browser was no longer an issue, but it was bad because it separates you from the underlying HTML, which means you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/gwt-why-verticalpanel-is-evil.html&#34;&gt;seriously mess up without realising&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s also hard to use CSS correctly when you don’t have access to all the HTML components.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So we come to more-or-less the present day, as it should be fairly obvious that during the time I’ve been working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver&#34;&gt;MongoDB Java Driver&lt;/a&gt; I haven’t done a lot of GUI development. I’m lucky because attending lots of conferences means I see a lot more of the current-trending technologies, but up until a couple of weeks ago I hadn’t had a chance to play with any of them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So now I’ve been trying &lt;a href=&#34;http://angular.js/&#34;&gt;Angular.js&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://getbootstrap.com/&#34;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/&#34;&gt;UI Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;.  My goodness.  It’s a whole &amp;lsquo;nother world.  I’m seeing at conferences and user groups that developers are increasingly polyglot, so maybe there’s no such thing as “just” a Java developer any more, but if you are “just” a Java developer, I think it could be… interesting… to get your head around some of the techniques.  Since we don’t have closures, our callbacks are ugly and we tend not to program that way.  Async is not something that comes naturally in a Java environment, I believe, although after working that way at LMAX I’m personally sold on it.  Old-world JavaScript developers like I am/was might also find it hard to understand you can have clean, testable JavaScript code which Just Works.  It didn’t even occur to me to worry about browser compatibility, and my app not only worked on my phone as well as my laptop, but looked really phone-ish and awesome with very minimal effort.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I’m currently on a plane on the way to QCon London where I’m &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2014/presentation/HTML5,%20Angular.js,%20Groovy,%20Java,%20MongoDB%20all%20together%20-%20what%20could%20possibly%20go%20wrong?&#34;&gt;going to demo&lt;/a&gt; this Brave New World of web development (together with a nice Java back end to prove how awesome Java is to work with and, of course, a MongoDB database).  So it is not my intention in this post to explore what this new world looks like.  But I have seen the Present, and it’s a lot better than the Past.  Kids These Days don’t know how good they’ve got it - they’ve never had to struggle, to fight the browser, to hand-craft their JavaScript like we have, or had to work with raw, low-level JSPs and Servlets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Now things are easier.  There are standards, there are libraries, there are best practices and YouTube videos showing you &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM&#34;&gt;how to create apps in 60 minutes&lt;/a&gt; (back in My Day I had to borrow someone else’s browser to use the Internet, and I debated for years the value of spending my own actual money on a Javascript actual paper actual book, which I could not afford).  Now, you can get something quite pretty and functionally interesting, working in a lot less time than I realised.  But that doesn’t mean the Kids These Days have it easier - it means there is so much more potential.  Instead of beating your head against trying to get a specific version of IE to do what you want, instead of having to write separate pages for different browsers (although maybe that still goes on), you can be exploring so much further into the possible, try things that no-one else has done yet.  It opens up so many interesting possibilities for apps on all platforms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Exciting times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So next time someone asks me “What is the de facto front-end framework for Java?” I’m going to say HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/should_you_notice_im_a_woman_should_i_care/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/should_you_notice_im_a_woman_should_i_care/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, following on from my observations of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2014/02/so-fosdem.html&#34;&gt;being an outsider&lt;/a&gt; at FOSDEM because I&amp;rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&amp;rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&amp;rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties.  But I&amp;rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At JFokus (a conference I really enjoyed, where I got a chance to spend time with some awesome people) I was on a panel (well, game-show really) about static vs dynamic languages.  Not unusually, I was the only woman on the panel.  Also not unusually, one of the reasons I agreed to take part is to do my bit in demonstrating that women have technical knowledge too (in my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important where possible to avoid a stage full of white men of a particular age, and I&amp;rsquo;m in a position to be able to do something about that).  And, as per usual, I was a bit nervous about this in case the only woman on the panel also turned out to look stupid, but hey, looking stupid is one of the risks of this job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the session, my gender was mentioned twice - once with &amp;ldquo;ladies first&amp;rdquo;, and once to specifically point out that our static-languages team was somehow superior because we had both genders represented (well of course we&amp;rsquo;re better, &lt;i&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m&lt;/i&gt; on the team). Note that neither of these was derogatory at all - both were, in fact, positive towards me, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t troubled or offended by them. I&amp;rsquo;m used to people noticing and commenting on my gender.  I got used to it in the same way you get used to your commute to work, or dealing with merge conflicts - it&amp;rsquo;s something you do, it&amp;rsquo;s not always comfortable, but it&amp;rsquo;s no one&amp;rsquo;s fault and they&amp;rsquo;re not out to get you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really process how the gender-mentions made me feel until after, at which point I was drained from giving yet another new talk that day, as well as the surprisingly physical panel discussion. But afterwards, when I was back in my hotel room packing for yet another plane journey, I was thinking &amp;ldquo;is it normal?&amp;rdquo;.  Was it inevitable that someone was going to notice/point out that I&amp;rsquo;m female? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it down to my choice of clothing?  I debated long and hard with myself about wearing what was definitely a ridiculously short skirt for a session like that, but in the end I decided I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wear jeans like everyone else, and wearing tiny skirts is something I find fun. But I did think I&amp;rsquo;d be behind a table and it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too obvious.  Should I worry that much about what I wear?  I used to plan what to wear for work, I used to love dressing up for going out with friends, so over-thinking my clothes for a conference is part of who I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one of the reasons to wear the skirt is because I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself wearing jeans and t-shirts more than ever.  I think the combination of travelling a lot (I &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; packing, so packing a couple of pairs of jeans and a bunch of t-shirts makes life easy) and being part of a tech company where that&amp;rsquo;s basically our uniform has lead to extreme laziness in my clothing choices, and I want to change that.  Who wants to look like everyone else?  Not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back in that hotel room, at the end of a long day, knowing I have to get up at 5am the next morning to get on a plane to New York, I felt drained.  I felt&amp;hellip; vulnerable? But if I dig down to find out what&amp;rsquo;s really making me feel not-cool, it&amp;rsquo;s not because a couple of people noticed I was a girl.  It&amp;rsquo;s because I was tired, because I was on display, because I had been worried about my choice of clothes, because drawing attention to yourself is not terribly British, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if my new talk was any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to blame impostor syndrome, or something similar. And maybe this is what impostor syndrome feels like. But I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure every conference speaker, whatever their gender, race, sexual orientation, age, has felt this way.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s because I have two X chromosomes and I&amp;rsquo;m in a male-dominated environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what conclusions to draw from this experience.  I did want to share it so that other people know what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re tired, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to blame the first thing that springs to mind for your lack of shiny-happy feelings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot on your plate, seemingly-innocuous (even those driven by positive intentions) comments or actions can increase your stress levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think too much.  It can drive you mad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So, FOSDEM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve heard great things about this conference, so I was pretty exited to go&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PmLM8wpvxns/UvaWZpqWFeI/AAAAAAAAMxI/dqKWFf_PH4M/s1600/JavaDevRoom.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PmLM8wpvxns/UvaWZpqWFeI/AAAAAAAAMxI/dqKWFf_PH4M/s1600/JavaDevRoom.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The Java dev room&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Now I know people talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome&#34;&gt;impostor syndrome&lt;/a&gt; whenever they mention the woeful lack of diversity at tech conferences.&amp;nbsp; Interestingly, I felt like an impostor at FOSDEM - not because I&#39;m a woman (there were quite a few techy women around at FOSDEM, more than I expected) but because I&#39;m not an open source person.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I mean, I am, technically - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; and the Java driver are both open source, and I have real live code on github.&amp;nbsp; But I didn&#39;t get there via the open source community, I was hired to do a specific job that happens to be open source (for which I am extremely grateful).&amp;nbsp; So although I knew the MongoDB folks I was there with and a lot of people who were running or speaking in the Java room, I didn&#39;t feel really at home in this conference.&amp;nbsp; I think I feel more comfortable with the ones aimed at enterprise Java developers (by which I mean Java people who work producing software for companies) because this is more similar to my background - I understand the attendees and I think I know what they want.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It&#39;s also possible since I&#39;ve been to a lot more of the enterprise-aimed conferences that I used to feel just as awkward there, and I&#39;ve become much more comfortable now I&#39;ve been to many.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Which leads me to another observation: when I first went to JavaOne, in 2011, I felt extremely conspicuous as a woman.&amp;nbsp; I mean, I didn&#39;t do much to help, my skirts and shorts are occasionally… not really enterprise-developer-length.&amp;nbsp; But I felt like everyone noticed me and I felt the pressure to assert early on in every new conversation that I was, in fact, a developer and not a booth babe or a recruiter.&amp;nbsp; But these days, I feel much more comfortable.&amp;nbsp; And do you know what&#39;s really helped with that?&amp;nbsp; Being a speaker; having my face on the website.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have to prove I&#39;m a developer, I was asked to speak at that conference - if the conference organisers think I belong there, then I belong there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So… what.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well, we can do things to combat this I-don&#39;t-belong-here feeling -&amp;nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve all been there, regardless of gender, race, background etc. &amp;nbsp;To be honest, us geeks probably feel this more than most humans.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Conferences and user groups and meet ups and so forth can all make life a little easier for those feeling this.&amp;nbsp; At the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, for example, we started having greeters at the door for our social events, to try and make everyone feel welcomed and to introduce people to each other.&amp;nbsp; I also liked what YOW did - they had a really informal social event at the end of the first day of the conference (with free booze, yay!) which made it relatively easy to mingle with other people.&amp;nbsp; FOSDEM, with its lack of free food and drink gave us less opportunities to mingle with people other than your own friends, although I did like the canteen area for random encounters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;But it&#39;s not just down to organisers of groups or events to solve this problem for us. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve found that if you do feel like you don&#39;t belong, there&#39;s a way to get over that, and it&#39;s not to withdraw.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s to get more involved.&amp;nbsp; Find the groups you feel most comfortable with (for me, it started at the LJC), find the medium that you&#39;re most comfortable with (in person meet-ups, e-mail, IRC, Twitter, whatever), and join in.&amp;nbsp; Have conversations.&amp;nbsp; Meet people.&amp;nbsp; Once you start to make friends you start to feel like you belong, and when you start to feel like you belong you can step up and do more.&amp;nbsp; You might even find yourself accidentally propelled into speaking at an international conference, and who knows where you find yourself after that?&amp;nbsp; Although I appreciate that&#39;s not for everyone.&amp;nbsp; The point is, find your comfort zone for entry and gradually push yourself more - as you find yourself more accepted and respected, you&#39;ll feel less like an outsider. &amp;nbsp;At the very least, you&#39;ll have friends to talk to at these sorts of events.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;And don&#39;t be put off by a couple of bad experiences - you don&#39;t have to go back to that group, those people, that thing, but don&#39;t assume that all groups or events are like that. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve been to a number of events, techy or otherwise, that I didn&#39;t feel at home with. &amp;nbsp;If, after two tries (in person, I&#39;ll give e-mails lists or chat rooms many more chances), I still don&#39;t get on with it, I try somewhere else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;There are still going to be times when you&#39;re not in your comfort zone, but this is probably healthy - pushing yourself a little leads to different opportunities.&amp;nbsp; And in my case, it reminded me what it was like to be an outsider, a newbie.&amp;nbsp; And that gives us greater empathy for people in that situation.&lt;/div&gt;

Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;in English? Whilst I&#39;m desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I&#39;m just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a MUG? Are people interested in joining a group that&#39;s solely focussed on one technology, a technology that might not have adoption here or even interest?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;two days notice? &amp;nbsp;Are you kidding? &amp;nbsp;I know people here like to figure out their plans at the last minute, but surely this is shooting ourselves in the foot before we even start.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZxzdtnwGKrk/UurinNqIjZI/AAAAAAAAMfQ/HHbZGT9MCV0/s1600/IMG_20140130_192137.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZxzdtnwGKrk/UurinNqIjZI/AAAAAAAAMfQ/HHbZGT9MCV0/s1600/IMG_20140130_192137.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then last night... &amp;nbsp;The people... they came. &amp;nbsp;On time. &amp;nbsp;And with their interesting stories and their varied backgrounds. &amp;nbsp;They listened, they asked questions, they wanted more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nU0wPfzI6DE/UuritPmwnDI/AAAAAAAAMfk/R49MwaxAzCk/s1600/IMG_20140130_201313.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nU0wPfzI6DE/UuritPmwnDI/AAAAAAAAMfk/R49MwaxAzCk/s1600/IMG_20140130_201313.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great event. &amp;nbsp;What an awesome city. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t wait for next month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--soNKu8wqYU/UurimtUlxPI/AAAAAAAAMfM/wh3q9UV1FLQ/s1600/IMG_20140130_192632.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--soNKu8wqYU/UurimtUlxPI/AAAAAAAAMfM/wh3q9UV1FLQ/s1600/IMG_20140130_192632.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;(Slides here, with usual caveats of them being pretty pointless on their own)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/30654613&#34; width=&#34;376&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote an article for the latest edition of Java Magazine which is an introduction to MongoDB for Java developers, and a nod to why it&amp;rsquo;s good in the &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&#34;0&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: #d2d2d2; height: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;www.oracle.com/javamagazine&#34; class=&#34;navlogo&#34; src=&#34;http://images-cdn.dashdigital.com/javamagazine/include/icons/navbar_logo.gif?lm=1390425195000&#34; height=&#34;28&#34; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;right&#34; style=&#34;color: #666666; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 15px; padding-right: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;top_right_text&#34;&gt;Look inside &amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;padding: 10px 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/jan_feb_2014?pg=52&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&#39;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/jan_feb_2014?pg=52&#39;,&#39;sharewidget&#39;,&#39;toolbar=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,left=0,top=0,width=&#39;+(screen.width-10)+&#39;,height=&#39;+(screen.height-10)+&#39;&#39;);return false;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;View Magazine&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;51&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://images-cdn.dashdigital.com/javamagazine/jan_feb_2014/data/imgpages/smtn/0052_vyvpwu.gif?lm=1390425195000&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: #d2d2d2; height: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;color: #666666; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 15px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;bottom_text&#34;&gt;MongoDB and Big Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why is it News when a woman becomes CEO?</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_is_it_news_when_a_woman_becomes_ceo/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_is_it_news_when_a_woman_becomes_ceo/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to see that GM has hired the &amp;ldquo;best person for the job&amp;rdquo; as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20131220221807-281874400-in-hiring-mary-barra-gm-s-board-did-more-than-break-the-mold&#34;&gt;their new CEO&lt;/a&gt; - that does seem like a good idea.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy her gender did not get in the way.  What makes me uncomfortable is the international news coverage of the decision of this large manufacturer to hire a woman as their CEO - if she were a man (and/or black/gay/disabled) would the headline read &amp;ldquo;The camera loves her. So do employees.&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at the root of that is probably the thing I&amp;rsquo;m most unhappy about.  What I&amp;rsquo;m not happy about is that it is 2014, halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, and she&amp;rsquo;s the first woman CEO of a car manufacturer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://corporate.ford.com/&#34;&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate and, later, a graduate.  I basically did my apprenticeship there. I know that over fifteen years ago they were hiring graduates from different disciplines (men and women), they had a women-in-leadership programme (or probably several, as I was only involved in the one for the IT organisation), they had a great maternity package (a great package for adoption too, but only the standard paternity package, ho-hum), on-site creches at the bigger locations, and were actively looking for ways to improve their diversity across the board.  They had issues on the plant floor which they were actively working to address, but management did not have a culture of discrimination, to my knowledge.  I remember the number of &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; techies in my IT graduate intake year, not the number of women, probably because the women were better represented than the coders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why has it taken so long for these old, old companies (Ford turned 100 while I was there) to put a woman into a position of leadership?  Maybe all these actions are what has, finally, lead to this mold-breaking appointment.  Or maybe decades of doing what is supposed to be the right thing is not having any impact at all - Mary Barra&amp;rsquo;s father worked at GM for 39 years, she herself started there as an intern and engineer, and has worked in different areas of the company as she&amp;rsquo;s risen through the ranks.  In this day and age, it&amp;rsquo;s probably more unusual to appoint a CEO who worked their way up to that position in that company than it is to appoint a woman - I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how many more there are out there when often it seems the best way to get a promotion now is to switch company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it took GM so long to appoint a female CEO, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how they managed to be the first of the big automotives.  And although I really hate all this &amp;ldquo;Oh wow, a woman CEO&amp;rdquo; news coverage (and I dare not read the comments because I know I&amp;rsquo;ll get angry), I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s something we need to do, to hold up these positive female role models, or something we should stop doing because all it does is point out how unusual women in leadership are - how news-worthy it is that a big, old organisation has finally joined the 21st century.  But the fact that I felt the need to blog about it I think means we still have a lot of work to do in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Goodbye 2013, you were good to me...</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/goodbye_2013_you_were_good_to_me/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, if &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxenter.com/guest-post-my-year-in-java-by-trisha-gee-45936.html&#34;&gt;I thought 2012 was the fastest disappearing year on record&lt;/a&gt;, that record was smashed into the ground by 2013.  What a year!  And because I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to write this on time to publish elsewhere, I can do a more personal reflection of the year here on my very own blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, reading over last year&amp;rsquo;s article, I had goals for 2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get more involved in schools/mentoring. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip; That didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I even made a single &lt;a href=&#34;http://graduatedevelopercommunity.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/gdc-meet-a-mentor/&#34;&gt;Meet a Mentor&lt;/a&gt; event this year, which is an excellent, really lightweight way of mentoring in London, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry I was unable to participate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contribute to a major release of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; Java Driver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I contributed&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still not ready for release yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give a keynote at an international conference.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope, didn&amp;rsquo;t manage this either!  But I did keynote at the LJC Open Conference again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;hellip;and more of the same from this year&lt;/b&gt;: presentations, user groups, blogging, workshops. &lt;br /&gt;Well, this I did manage.  More on that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I foresee a lot of travel in my future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was even more than I imagined.  And a big bit of travel that I did not anticipate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also made zero progress on the book I signed up to do in 2012, and did not start the other book I have simmering in my head, although I really hope that YOW has given me enough momentum to make a start on that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, what a let down, right?  I only managed two of my five resolutions, what a sucky year!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not at all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What an amazing, busy, life changing year (yeah, but every year changes your life in some big or tiny way, right?  Otherwise we&amp;rsquo;d be standing still).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2013 was the year I got stuck into my new job.  I have to admit, the &lt;b&gt;evangelism&lt;/b&gt; bit was kinda tricky when you have to sign up for conferences months in advance, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know a) anything about MongoDB (shh, don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone) and b) what my strengths or interests would be.  Given we were &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/58136652766/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0&#34;&gt;re-writing and re-designing the Java driver&lt;/a&gt;, I opted to create a fluffy talk on software design, that I could evolve over the year as we learnt more during the driver re-write.  And because I apparently still follow the &amp;ldquo;say yes to everything&amp;rdquo; policy from 2012 (something that&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be a theme of 2013, and made my life trickier than it should have been) I&amp;rsquo;ve given a couple of other talks on things that I can&amp;rsquo;t help ranting about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Development&lt;/b&gt;-wise, we&amp;rsquo;ve made progress on the new Java driver, but I&amp;rsquo;ve felt unable to contribute as much as I had expected to - travel and conference preparation take a lot more time out of my schedule than I ever realised it would, not to mention the cost of context switching.  However, I am proud of some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve brought to the project, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;gradle&lt;/a&gt;, coding standards (automated with checkstyle, findbugs and codenarc), &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/spock-is-awesome-seriously-simplified.html&#34;&gt;Spock testing&lt;/a&gt; (as well as a general focus on automated testing), and addressed all outstanding pull requests.  As well as creating a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/mongodb-java-tutorial&#34;&gt;tutorial for the new Java driver&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a start on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/wiki/Getting-Started:-IntelliJ-Setup&#34;&gt;better documentation&lt;/a&gt;.  These last two are areas I&amp;rsquo;d like to progress further in 2014.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done quite a lot of &lt;b&gt;community&lt;/b&gt; support this year too.  Although I find it hard to answer most of the questions off the top of my head because I&amp;rsquo;m still learning, answering questions on Google groups and StackOverflow has probably been the best way for me to learn about MongoDB, particularly how Java and JVM developers are interacting with it.  And from barely having any points on StackOverflow I&amp;rsquo;ve now got over a thousand - yay!  Hurrah for gamification, it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect carrot for Trish-shaped people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve done less &lt;b&gt;writing&lt;/b&gt; on the blog in 2013 than in 2012, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to have posted some more meaty technical content in the form of the Spock blogs (I feel like my conference write-ups are just filler, but people seem to like them so I&amp;rsquo;m going to carry on unless otherwise instructed).  I also made my debut on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;mongodb.org blog&lt;/a&gt; and on the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Developers Blog with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/11/technical-tests-youre-doing-it-wrong.html&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/12/technical-tests-youre-doing-it-wrong-part-2.html&#34;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; piece on technical testing in job interviews.  I&amp;rsquo;d really like to focus more on my writing in 2014, not just my blog but more guest posts and more magazines.  But I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be over-ambitious and claim any of my book-writing is going to happen.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The highlight of my year was moving to Seville (Spain) in August.  Moving out of London definitely made is almost impossible to hit my previous resolution of mentoring, and means I&amp;rsquo;m no longer as active in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s such a great place to come home to when I&amp;rsquo;ve been travelling.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And speaking of &lt;b&gt;travel&lt;/b&gt;, I guess this has made up the majority of my 2013.  So I&amp;rsquo;m going to bore you with a summary of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;January&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;: Spent a week locked in a meeting room in our NYC office with my co-conspirator on the Java driver.  I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/05/adjusting-to-working-remotely.html&#34;&gt;working remotely&lt;/a&gt;, but this week spent on location was worth more than months of working from home - not only did I get to meet/hang out with colleagues, but I got to know my main co-worker much better than I would have otherwise (even with video conferences), and it was instrumental to creating a productive working environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got back to London, I was flattered to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/gdl-presents-women-techmakers-with.html&#34;&gt;interviewed&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Women Tech Makers series.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;March&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bna8gUVChg4/UsVyxoWynJI/AAAAAAAAMLU/ZVLBO1M1Gko/s1600/20130308-QCon.jpg&#34;

and I are particularly passionate about this topic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At QCon I gave a workshop on the new Java driver, which had limited attendance and required me to re-think the tutorial.  I was a bit discouraged by this, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, but later in the year I built off this experience, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I learnt something from it and managed to improve too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As a presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/08/life-on-both-sides-of-interview-table.html&#34;&gt;Dan North and I talked about interviewing&lt;/a&gt; - mostly from the point of view of the interviewer, but also there should be plenty of tips if you&amp;rsquo;re currently looking for a job. At the time, I was concerned about this presentation as it was a very last-minute thing, but we&amp;rsquo;ve had some great feedback from the talk which makes it all worthwhile.  I find co-presenting a little tricky because a) you have to work around another&amp;rsquo;s schedule/style/interests and b) when I&amp;rsquo;m co-presenting with someone with an awesome reputation it makes me feel like a shy schoolgirl, which is not great for stage presence.  But this session was a lot of fun, and working with someone with more experience is the best way to get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/i&gt;: Hot on the heels of QCon was the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/04/devoxx-uk-2013.html&#34;&gt;Devoxx conference in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.  If there&amp;rsquo;s something I learnt from this experience, it&amp;rsquo;s to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be on the programme committee for two conferences that happen in the same month, and present at both of them.  But however difficult it was behind the scenes, Devoxx was an absolutely brilliant conference as a speaker and attendee.  It&amp;rsquo;s also where I first presented &amp;ldquo;What do you mean, backwards compatibility&amp;rdquo;, the talk that&amp;rsquo;s been evolving all year, using the Java driver as a case study for software design.  I also co-presented on an intro to NoSQL with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kimbertles&#34;&gt;Kim Ross&lt;/a&gt; - I should try and get that video online actually, it might be good to publish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The last weekend in March, after these two brilliant but exhausting conferences, my boyfriend and I had a conversation which, somehow, unexpectedly, led to us investigating a move to Spain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;April&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I took myself away from London for two weeks and managed to actually get some code done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York&lt;/i&gt;: A Grand Meeting of the JVM and C# teams.  Sat in a room with everyone I got a much better idea of the motivation behind a lot of our design choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trip to New York was a bit of a disaster on the personal front, losing my phone, having things stolen from the hotel room, being put on two broken planes at JFK before finally having to go back to Manhattan overnight so that we could fly the next day.  But these are all first world problems, solvable with time or money (or both), and you just move on to the next thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Francisco: &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/11/javaone-2013.html&#34;&gt;My third outing to JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;.  As always, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the people you meet out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;October&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;and I still haven&amp;rsquo;t been home yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AIOugdenRG4/UsV5ZpeNKgI/AAAAAAAAMNA/tjgWYrmLIGQ/s1600/20130930-Aarhus.jpg&#34;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aarhus&lt;/i&gt;: Finally made it to GOTO Aarhus, it&amp;rsquo;s the first year I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited and not had a clash with JavaOne.  The sneaky beggars made me track host of the Careers track to ensure my attendance.  I never blogged about Aarhus because I got further and further behind on the blogging (instead of having loads of opportunity on the plane, like you&amp;rsquo;d think I would have, the more travel I did the more likely it was I would fall asleep in front of a movie instead).  I gave two talks here, both different to anything I&amp;rsquo;d done all year, because what you need when you&amp;rsquo;re on a plane and in hotels for a whole month is to decide, for your last conference in the tour, to do something completely different (Note To Self: Do not do this again).  The first was &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/video#36&#34;&gt;Career Advice for Programmers&lt;/a&gt;, a talk I was disappointed with because I have so much to share and 50 minutes was not enough.  Probably more suitable for those starting their careers than senior developers.  The second was &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/video#55&#34;&gt;Top Ten IntelliJ Tips&lt;/a&gt; (with special guest star Dan North), which also didn&amp;rsquo;t go as well as I&amp;rsquo;d liked, because live coding is fraught with danger, but if people pick up just one tip from it, I&amp;rsquo;ve done my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aarhus was a great conference that I simply didn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate as I spent most of the time asleep or preparing both talks.  Four cities back to back is simply too much, especially if the Atlantic separates some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I was eventually allowed home for a week, then it was&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gxWFQPZrTV8/UsV6YXJaTPI/AAAAAAAAMNY/2PsnyYiqAb0/s1600/20131016-Berlin.jpg&#34;

I panicked a LOT about JAX (I apologise to the organisers for passing on my panic without giving them enough notice for them to be able to help me), in particular the half day workshop I gave, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that went well at QCon.  And it scared the crap out of me to find out 30 people had signed up and more wanted to come.  But after putting a lot of work in to the preparation, and taking into account the lessons I learnt at QCon, this tutorial went really well, and I&amp;rsquo;m ready to give it at conferences next year.  Also, I think tutorials are the right place to talk in depth about MongoDB and to teach people about what it is and how it works, and presentations are a better platform for more general things that apply to a wider audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have almost no photos from this trip to London (apart from a couple of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tddmonkey&#34;&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; pretending he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to drink at the LJC Community Night) - looks like I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to bring my camera, since one of the few I have is via the iPad.  This is what you look like when you visit eight different cities in less than two months:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Zealand&lt;/i&gt;: How exciting, an Actual Holiday.  Because I get to travel all the time, and often get to see the cities I visit, I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken any real time off since February.  As we were going to be in Australia anyway, we got a chance to see New Zealand - a country I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to visit, ever since my uncle lived there when I was a child. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;December&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Australia&lt;/i&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;ve already given a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/12/yow.html&#34;&gt;very detailed round-up of YOW&lt;/a&gt;.  If I say it was my favourite conference of the year, people will remind me that I&amp;rsquo;ve said that of more than one conference.  But it was an amazing way to round off an incredible year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9bSI8MiPXsk/UsV5_nEZUEI/AAAAAAAAMNQ/O4edUd550Q4/s1600/20131208-YOW.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9bSI8MiPXsk/UsV5_nEZUEI/AAAAAAAAMNQ/O4edUd550Q4/s400/20131208-YOW.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it.  2013 was a year in which I travelled all over the globe, visiting two continents for the first time as well as jetting around Europe and the States.  It&amp;rsquo;s a year where I started to learn a new language (Groovy) and continued to make very limited progress learning another (Spanish). It&amp;rsquo;s a year in which I struggled to find the balance between all the parts of my job and my personal life, not always getting it right, but learning a lot in the process.  Sure, reading the travel bits make me feel like I spent a lot of it fairly stressed, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a year where I found a lot of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, 2014, I have plans for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Travel less&lt;/i&gt;.  At the end of 2013 my batteries were extremely empty, the back-to-back travel has a much larger impact than simply the time it takes out of the schedule to get somewhere.  This resolution is not just about not getting on a plane, I want to focus a bit closer to home - Madrid and Barcelona, I hope you guys don&amp;rsquo;t mind presentations in English - including investing in local communities in Seville.  But for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t here in Spain, I have plans to compensate for this lack of physical interaction with people like&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;More remote presentations&lt;/i&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/&#34;&gt;vJUG&lt;/a&gt; presentation went much much better than I expected, and it took a lot less time out of my schedule.  It was also a lot of fun.  I also want to do more webinars, screencasts, and so on.  On a related note&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;More writing&lt;/i&gt;.  Yeah, I probably said this last year.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve got a backlog of things for the blog, plus a number of other magazine articles I&amp;rsquo;d like to do.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got loads of things I want to write up for our official documentation too.  And this isn&amp;rsquo;t just pictures and stories, but code-heavy stuff as well, like&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Workshops and tutorials&lt;/i&gt;.  These are a better platform for learning about MongoDB at conferences (better than an hour-long talk anyway), and with a bit of effort should translate into something that can be done by anyone, anywhere.  We already have a free education course for Java &amp;amp; MongoDB, but I want to offer even more examples of how to code against our driver and the other libraries people might be using.  And not all these libraries are in Java-the-language, for example&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do More Groovy&lt;/i&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve really surprised myself, because I&amp;rsquo;m a die-hard, too-old-to-learn-new-tricks Java person, and I&amp;rsquo;m falling for Groovy - I love that the syntax is Java-ish but slick and descriptive.  I want to continue with the Spock stuff in the driver, but I have ideas for a load of other Groovy things I could do in the Java/JVM/MongoDB world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s plenty to sign up for right now.  Speaking of which, I&amp;rsquo;ve sort of failed at point 1 already, and I might see you at one of these:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;31st Jan - 2nd Feb&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosdem.org/2014/&#34;&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be lurking in the NoSQL room.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th Feb&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp#Whatdoyoumean%2Cbackwa&#34;&gt;JFokus&lt;/a&gt;.  I can&amp;rsquo;t stay for the whole conference as I have to fly to NY.  Wait, what did I say about not doing things back to back?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th Feb - 12th Feb&lt;/b&gt;: In New York for company meeting stuff.  Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be back, feels like a long time.  I wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying to find a JUG to speak at, or if I should stick with my usual schedule of catching up with friends and colleagues, and shopping?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd Mar - 6th Mar&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2014/speaker/Trisha+Gee&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;.  Currently scheduled for another MongoDB tutorial and a talk (about groovy, yay!).  Schedule will change, because I&amp;rsquo;m currently clashing with&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;7th Mar&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://joyofcoding.org/&#34;&gt;Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt;.  Not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about, votes welcome&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;20th May - 21st May&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2013/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.  Again, not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m presenting on.  Will also probably spend some time in NYC while I&amp;rsquo;m in the neighbourhood.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So yeah&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s my quiet 2014&amp;hellip;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&amp;rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats.  A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PWSc0RE99iQ/UrhWxezIRSI/AAAAAAAAMB8/wQSmg4lwVl8/s1600/Cliff.jpg&#34;

is a long way away from Australia) but make it cost effective - although you have to shuttle the speakers between the cities, you have the speakers for nearly two weeks and get the material three times in the three different locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVUihtZxvfY/UrhXL-fc8cI/AAAAAAAAMCE/J9RjMWAhOjY/s1600/1Coogee.jpg&#34;

It looked at each of the SOLID principles, where they came from, what they are, helped us understand why we need to care about them (or not).  It became clear to me that as we become more experienced, as we grow, we need to continually re-visit the things we think we know, or the basics of what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, as you&amp;rsquo;ll find things there that surprise you - things you thought you understood, or things that you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand before and now have more context for.  In particular, I learnt another argument against using inheritance willy-nilly (one of my current favourite bug-bears)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing software is like writing fiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts say &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo; because they know a number of rules which might be applicable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t change &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html&#34;&gt;published interfaces&lt;/a&gt; because other people are dependent upon your code (pretty much the entire basis of my Backwards Compatibility talk), but if you own the code you can change it to your heart&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f116466b93322f4900000f?track=Service+%2F+API+Design&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Creating Observable APIs with Rx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ben Christensen (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/benjchristensen&#34;&gt;@benjchristensen&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Netflix are doing some really amazing stuff with architecture, design and code, and what I love the most is that they&amp;rsquo;re willing to share it with the rest of us. Rx and reactive programming are big buzz words at the moment, and the event-driven, asynchronous approach is something that we embraced at LMAX and is now, to my mind, an &amp;ldquo;obvious&amp;rdquo; way to create scalable systems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I liked Ben&amp;rsquo;s visualisation of the events in the system using marble diagrams, and I liked that he showed us code and walked through it.  There were a number of things to get your head around in the talk, and I personally would like to see it again to see what I missed first time around.  Definitely worth watching if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this way of coding, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a paradigm that will be used more and more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51fbdf7d9bd61f5a2a00000c?track=Peopleware&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Hiring (or Growing) the Right Agile Coach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lyssa Adkins (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lyssaadkins&#34;&gt;@lyssaadkins&lt;/a&gt;) and Michael Spayd (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mspayd&#34;&gt;@mspayd&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it never occurred to me that you could create a framework for professional development for agile coaches.  Lyssa and Michael have done just that, and having something a bit more formalised helps figure out what a coach needs to do in order to develop further.  Agile coach, scrum master, iteration lead&amp;hellip; all these titles do not currently tell anyone how good you are at the job or what your strengths and weaknesses are.  The Agile Coach Competency Framework seems like a good starting point for conversations around: the coaches you have; the coaches you need; your current skills as a coach; the direction you want to go in as a coach.  If you need to hire or develop an agile coach, or if you are a professional in this space, this is worth looking at.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef8426950e81d4a300000b?track=Concurrency&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Disruptor 3.0: Details and Advanced Patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mike Barker (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mikeb2701&#34;&gt;@mikeb2701&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was so pleased to hang around with my old LMAX colleague during YOW that I totally failed to take the time to see all of this talk.  Depending upon the city it either clashed with mine or was immediately before.  However, it&amp;rsquo;s a must-see for fans of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, Mike goes into detail about what&amp;rsquo;s in the latest version of the Disruptor, how and why these things work.  I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be watching the video when it&amp;rsquo;s online.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef9cf09ff771058e00001b?track=Keynote&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Angle Brackets, Curly Braces, JavaScript &amp;amp;

at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/lean-software-and-systems-conference.html&#34;&gt;Lean conference at Bletchley in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.  In this talk I was struck once again how important the words we use are: should, given/when/then, and so on, giving us a framework for thinking about a problem.  It&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons I wanted to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/spock&#34;&gt;move towards Spock&lt;/a&gt;, because it forces the use of some of these words.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wrote lots of notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assume you got it wrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a context in which the event will create a different outcome? (Your account is empty, the ATM is out of cash, you have a pre-approved overdraft)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t think of the software that will solve the problem, assume it will be done by pixies (like &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Iconograph&#34;&gt;Pratchett&amp;rsquo;s Iconograph&lt;/a&gt;), forcing us to stop thinking of solutions when we&amp;rsquo;re trying to outline the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all user stories are about the user, they might be about other stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acceptance criteria vs scenarios - &amp;ldquo;Can you give me an example?&amp;ldquo;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask why a change needs to be made or why something is a bug, if I&amp;rsquo;ve messed up this feature I might have messed up something else&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testers do think differently to developers, they have a process of deliberate discovery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;BA/Dev/Tester huddle - the three amigos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a project has no risks, don&amp;rsquo;t do it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complicated/Complex/Chaotic/Simple projects/systems.  Some types of systems don&amp;rsquo;t lend themselves well to BDD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All the risk is in Complex problems, and this is also likely where the value is.  This is the area that developers tend to like to live.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Afterwards I questioned Liz on her separation of Devs and Testers in the talk - this seems contra to the current trend of hiring developers-in-test or other moves to make QAs and developers one-team-one-dream.  She pointed out that it&amp;rsquo;s less of a job description and more of a role that people take in a team.  Then she suggested I was currently in a tester role, not developer, as my mindset is very much focussed around proving our code quality rather than jumping in and implementing features.  I think it was meant as a positive thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

is another one of these buzz words doing the rounds at the moment.  There was a lot of discussion amongst the speakers about how micro is micro, and one definition I liked was &amp;ldquo;a microservice is a service that does one thing and one thing only&amp;rdquo;.   In Sam&amp;rsquo;s talk I got an idea of why microservices are a Good Thing, and how you might go about moving in that direction.  There was practical advice on things you should be doing if you&amp;rsquo;re using this kind of architecture:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align your services with your organisational structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microservices let you deploy independently and move faster, and you can run each service in whichever technology / language is right for the job&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standardisation vs autonomy - standardisation between services, autonomy within.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick conventions and stick with them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try not to support distributed transactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to get better at monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can create tracer messages that flow through the system&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create templates that do the right thing, make it easy for people to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51f109ba6b9332a9d4000008?track=Visualisation&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Google Earth Engine: Enabling Science with Novel Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mike Dixon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I saw this because I&amp;rsquo;m interested in geolocation and geo-stuff at the moment, but this talk wasn&amp;rsquo;t really about the sort of thing I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with.  It was (to my mind) really interesting material though - using satellite images from the past few decades to spot patterns and predict things.  It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to see applications of technology that could potentially impact the whole world, rather than just things that make money for companies.  My Dad, who&amp;rsquo;s a geography teacher, would have loved this talk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef87399ff771873d000010?track=Cloud+At+Scale&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Cloud Native Architecture at Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;Adrian Cockcroft (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/adrianco&#34;&gt;@adrianco&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really interesting talk, always to a packed room, about how Netflix has created a scalable architecture.  As I said earlier, I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed with what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in their chaos monkeys and primates.  I definitely recommend seeing this presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

(I wrote that down and now don&amp;rsquo;t remember the context, but it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting point)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s so many things you can do by innovating and adopting a new language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51fbdd9b2e4c941eff00000c?track=Agile+Practices&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Focusing the Core Domain: Domain-Driven Design Case Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eric Evans (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/ericevans0&#34;&gt;@ericevans0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I always love meeting people who&amp;rsquo;s books I&amp;rsquo;ve read (or at least, started).  I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in the Domain Driven Design stuff since the guys were banging on about it at LMAX, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use some of the concepts to drive the design of the new Java driver for MongoDB. This presentation was a specific (anonymised) case study of applying Domain Driven Design.  My main take away point is that &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; plunging into development, that asking questions, that waiting, is sometimes the best thing you can do.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/51ef94039ff771873d00003d?track=Mobile+Development&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;Mobile Web Whirlwind Tour of PhoneGap, Cordova &amp;amp;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Scrum-type methodologies tend to focus on user stories and feature delivery.  This presentation talks about physically colouring the different types of work that you have in your backlog (tech debt, bugs, stories, architecture) and understanding how to prioritise each of them.  This talk is worth seeing if you are in a Scrum-ish environment, and you have a backlog of stories.  If you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to find time to address tech debt, this is probably applicable too.  For me, the take-away point was simply having visibility of the different types of work - often the backlog only contains stories, and the other stuff is missing.  From there, you&amp;rsquo;re in a better position to work out how to prioritise things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://a.confui.com/public/conferences/517fce8207933939cd000001/locations/517fce8207933939cd000002/schedule/topics/52725f4c403edc223500004f?track=Mobile+Development&amp;amp;framehost=http://melbourne.yowconference.com.au&#34;&gt;No App is an Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stewart Gleadow (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/stewgleadow&#34;&gt;@stewgleadow&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;More and more people are talking about APIs, especially as we now have lots of different ways of getting to data/applications, even if you just think web/phone/tablet.  Stew gives very solid advice on how to build APIs so that you can correctly separate back- and front-end, and create (specifically) great iOS apps.  There&amp;rsquo;s a good intro to what REST really means too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different devices don&amp;rsquo;t have to share the same API if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well for them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Objective C: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like ugly Ruby, or beautiful Java&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;From day one send the information about the client version, the handset etc. to the server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must worry about backwards compatibility because there&amp;rsquo;s a very long tail on app upgrades&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Libraries that bind your JSON have tight coupling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can ship client code that checks if a feature is available on the server and ignore it if not - that lets you turn on the feature at the server-end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage upgrades to the new version, by doing things like &amp;ldquo;if you had version 347 you could use this feature&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phone application is the hardest thing to change so it should not be your integration point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need an anti-corruption layer, your phone should not be pointing to the internal systems.  This will be your mobile API, and can include caching and security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your logic is in the client, it&amp;rsquo;s in the place that&amp;rsquo;s hardest to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

a number of times this year.  It morphed from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; into two different talks - &amp;ldquo;Design is a Process, not a Document&amp;rdquo; and a more MongoDB-focussed one, which I reused the original title for.  This newer, MongoDB-focussed one is what I gave at GOTO Berlin, and I decided to use this for YOW as it&amp;rsquo;s a technical (ish) talk that goes into some detail about MongoDB, and they do pay my rent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The really great (or possibly, bad) thing about YOW is that because it&amp;rsquo;s the same conference at three venues, only a few days apart, it gives you a chance to put your Lean Startup knowledge into practice - you can experiment, get feedback, and improve.  Like the GOTOs/QCons, they have a Green/Yellow/Red feedback system from the audience so you can get a feel for how they liked your talk (the Aussies are a bit non-committal, they were keen on the Yellow button - commit one way or another!! (or don&amp;rsquo;t, I don&amp;rsquo;t want more reds)).  So decided to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&#34;&gt;A/B test&lt;/a&gt; my talk - at Melbourne, I gave the GOTO Berlin one; at Brisbane, the original one with updated code and design diagrams.  Since the Brisbane one got a higher score, I went with that with some minor tweaks for Sydney.  The upshot is, people like hand-drawn pictures of monsters, and are less keen on understanding the internals of MongoDB.  That&amp;rsquo;s useful to know.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br class=&#34;Apple-interchange-newline&#34; /&gt;But the talks aren&amp;rsquo;t the only things that make a conference.  And YOW got the other stuff right too:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s1600/1Catamaran.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tw7VJOelqZI/UrhYDYgURFI/AAAAAAAAMCw/7sGUtQo8QnQ/s320/1Catamaran.jpg&#34; width=&#34;265&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the drinks receptions in the evenings, that&amp;rsquo;s a great place for people to come and ask you questions about your talk, stuff they might not want to share in front of everyone.  Note to attendees - if you do see a speaker at a drinks/network/mingle event, feel free to chat to them.  We&amp;rsquo;re there for you guys, and we&amp;rsquo;re only people ourselves and like the company.  At many events, the speakers know very few people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sydney had an outdoor eating area, which was awesome - if you&amp;rsquo;re going to spend weeks in a conference hall, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to get outside for food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was a, um, misunderstanding about appropriate dress code for one of the vendors.  The conference organisers were on this immediately, and, to their credit, the vendor acted swiftly with no fuss.  A great example of how to handle this sort of thing at tech conferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having all the travel and accommodation, particularly for this complicated trip, arranged by very capable and approachable people made the speakers&amp;rsquo; lives really easy, and I think that helped us to be more prepared and relaxed for our talks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A speaker&amp;rsquo;s excursion (on a boat!) at the weekend was an amazing way to bond with the other guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I loved YOW, I hope I can go again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spock: Data Driven Testing</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/spock_data_driven_testing/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/spock_data_driven_testing/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two articles on Spock I&amp;rsquo;ve covered &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/spock-is-awesome-seriously-simplified.html&#34;&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/spock-passes-next-test-painless-stubbing.html&#34;&gt;stubbing&lt;/a&gt;.  And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that.  But for a database driver, there&amp;rsquo;s a killer feature:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.spockframework.org/en/latest/data_driven_testing.html&#34;&gt;Data Driven Testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path.  Not least of all because that&amp;rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &amp;ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&amp;rdquo;.  We tend not to ask &amp;ldquo;what happens if they ask to withdraw money when the cash machine has no cash?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;what happens when their account balance is zero?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any luck you&amp;rsquo;ll have a test suite covering your happy paths, and probably at least twice as many grumpy paths.  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and you like one test to test one thing (and who doesn&amp;rsquo;t?), sometimes your test classes can get quite long as you test various edge cases.  Or, much worse (and I&amp;rsquo;ve done this too) you use a calculation remarkably like the one you&amp;rsquo;re testing to generate test data.  You run your test in a loop with the calculation and lo!  The test passes.  Woohoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that long ago I went through a process of re-writing a lot of unit tests that I had written a year or two before - we were about to do a big refactor of the code that generated some important numbers, and we wanted our tests to tell us we hadn&amp;rsquo;t broken anything with the refactor. The only problem was, the tests used a calculation rather similar to the production calculation, and borrowed some constants to create the expected number.  I ended up running the tests to find the numbers the test was generating as expected values, and hardcoding those values into the test. It felt dirty, but it was necessary - I wanted to make sure the refactoring didn&amp;rsquo;t change the expected numbers as well as the ones generated by the real code.  This is not a process I want to go through ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re testing these sorts of things, you try and think of a few representative cases, code them into your tests, and hope that you&amp;rsquo;ve covered the main areas.  What would be far nicer is if you could shove a whole load of different data into your system-under-test and make sure the results look sane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example from the Java driver is that we had tests that were checking the parsing of the URI - you can initialise your MongoDB settings simply using a String containing the URI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old tests looked like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8056046.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/master/src/test/com/mongodb/MongoClientURITest.java&#34;&gt;MongoClientURITest&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Spock&amp;rsquo;s data driven testing, we changed this to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8056095.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/3.0.x/driver/src/test/unit/org/mongodb/MongoClientURISpecification.groovy&#34;&gt;MongoClientURISpecification&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of having a separate test for every type of URL that needs parsing, you have a single test and each line in the &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;where:&lt;/span&gt; section is a new combination of input URL and expected outputs.  Each one of those lines used to be a test.  In fact, some of them probably weren&amp;rsquo;t tests as the ugliness and overhead of adding another copy-paste test seemed like overkill.  But here, in Spock, it&amp;rsquo;s just a case of adding one more line with a new input and set of outputs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major benefit here, to me, is that it&amp;rsquo;s dead easy to add another test for a &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo; that occurs to the developer.  You don&amp;rsquo;t have to have yet another test method that someone else is going to wonder &amp;ldquo;what the hell are we testing this for?&amp;rdquo;.  You just add another line which documents another set of expected outputs given the new input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s neat, it&amp;rsquo;s succinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major benefits of this to our team is that we don&amp;rsquo;t argue any more about whether a single test is testing too much.  In the past, we had tests like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8056136.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; And I can see why we have all those assertions in the same test, because technically these are all the same concept - make sure that each type of WriteConcern creates the correct command document.  I believe these should be one test per line - because each line in the test is testing a different input and output, and I would want to document that in the test name (&amp;ldquo;fsync write concern should have fsync flag in getLastError command&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;journalled write concern should set j flag to true in getLastError command&amp;rdquo; etc).  Also don&amp;rsquo;t forget that in JUnit, if the first assert fails, the rest of the test is not run.  Therefore you have no idea if this is a failure that affects all write concerns, or just the first one.  You lose the coverage provided by the later asserts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the argument against my viewpoint is then we&amp;rsquo;d have seven different one-line tests.  What a waste of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could argue for days about the best way to do it, or that this test is a sign of some other smell that needs addressing.  But if you&amp;rsquo;re in a real world project and your aim is to both improve your test coverage and improve the tests themselves, these arguments are getting in the way of progress.  The nice thing about Spock is that you can take these tests that test too much, and turn them into something a bit prettier:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8056166.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; You might be thinking, what&amp;rsquo;s the advantage over the JUnit way?  Isn&amp;rsquo;t that the same thing but Groovier?  But there&amp;rsquo;s one important difference - all the lines under &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;where:&lt;/span&gt; get run, regardless of whether the test before it passes or fails.  This basically is seven different tests, but takes up the same space as one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s great, but if just one of these lines fails, how do you know which one it was if all seven tests are masquerading as one?  That&amp;rsquo;s where the awesome &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;@Unroll&lt;/span&gt; annotation comes in.  This reports the passing or failing of each line as if it were a separate test.  By default, when you run an unrolled test it will get reported as something like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zFO5Jwl5upA/UrRgIlxq3SI/AAAAAAAAMBQ/c6WG-FhP_P4/s1600/Unroll1.tiff&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zFO5Jwl5upA/UrRgIlxq3SI/AAAAAAAAMBQ/c6WG-FhP_P4/s1600/Unroll1.tiff&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the test above we put some magic keywords into the test name: &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;&#39;&lt;b&gt;#wc&lt;/b&gt; should return getlasterror document &lt;b&gt;#commandDocument&lt;/b&gt;&#39;&lt;/span&gt; - note that these values with &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; in front are the same headings from the &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;where:&lt;/span&gt; section. They&amp;rsquo;ll get replaced by the value being run in the current test:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2KnezQJM7R4/UrRgyNH_SHI/AAAAAAAAMBY/5TEwt2o691E/s1600/Unroll2.tiff&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2KnezQJM7R4/UrRgyNH_SHI/AAAAAAAAMBY/5TEwt2o691E/s1600/Unroll2.tiff&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it can be a bit of a mouthful if the &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt; is hefty, but it does give you an idea of what was being tested, and it&amp;rsquo;s prettier if the inputs have nice succinct string values:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E7X8nOwjOQI/UrRiGPse7cI/AAAAAAAAMBk/7Y1-MvPvUxk/s1600/Unroll3.tiff&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E7X8nOwjOQI/UrRiGPse7cI/AAAAAAAAMBk/7Y1-MvPvUxk/s1600/Unroll3.tiff&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, combined with Spock&amp;rsquo;s awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://hamletdarcy.blogspot.com.es/2009/05/new-power-assertions-in-groovy.html&#34;&gt;power assert&lt;/a&gt; makes it dead simple to see what went wrong when one of these tests fails.  Let&amp;rsquo;s take the example of (somehow) the incorrect host being returned for one of the input URIs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uoemw3QA594/UrRiQoYr_II/AAAAAAAAMBs/wJQBQa8XhOM/s1600/Unroll4.tiff&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uoemw3QA594/UrRiQoYr_II/AAAAAAAAMBs/wJQBQa8XhOM/s1600/Unroll4.tiff&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Data driven testing might lead one to over-test the simple things, but the cost of adding another &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo; is so low - just another line - and the additional safety you get from trying a different input is rather nice.  We&amp;rsquo;ve been using them for parsers and simple generators, where you want to throw in a bunch of inputs to a single method and see what you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m totally sold on this feature, particularly for our type of application (the Java driver does a lot of taking stuff in one shape and turning it into something else).  Just in case you want a final example, here&amp;rsquo;s a final one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8057097.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &amp;hellip;and in Spock:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/8057129.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/&#34;&gt;vJUG&lt;/a&gt;, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span
geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&amp;rsquo;m not in London - if we can find
good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&amp;rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&amp;rsquo;t have
a local user group to go to. Not to mention cutting travel costs and saving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See the event, and the record of the IRC chat, here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides are also online, but obviously they&amp;rsquo;re part of the video as well:&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>JAX London &amp; MongoDB Tutorial</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__mongodb_tutorial/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__mongodb_tutorial/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get
there, and not because of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/27/its-ok-to-take-the-morning-off-work-if-storm-hits-michael-fish-says-so-4162862/&#34;&gt;Super Storm&lt;/a&gt;.  Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on
Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute,
oh no&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java
Community. For example, presenting were: &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/andy-piper&#34;&gt;Andy Piper&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a
href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/barry-cranford&#34;&gt;Barry Cranford&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/james-gough&#34;&gt;Jim
Gough&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/peter-lawrey&#34;&gt;Peter Lawrey&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon
.com/speakers/sandro-mancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/simon-maple&#34;&gt;Simon Maple&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a
href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/martijn-verburg&#34;&gt;Martijn Verburg&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-oliver&#34;&gt;John
Oliver&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/john-stevenson&#34;&gt;John Stevenson&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon
.com/speakers/richard-warburton&#34;&gt;Richard Warburton&lt;/a&gt;. The Community Night in particular also drew a lot of LJC members (including some
first-timers) to JAX, and it was a really good &amp;ldquo;networking opportunity&amp;rdquo; (i.e. chance to have free drinks,
catch up with friends and make new ones). I really enjoyed hanging out with everyone at JAX this year,
I was tempted to write the names of everyone I spoke to and had fun with because it really made my conference,
but I think that would make a very boring blog post. But if I spoke to you at JAX, you made my journey from Spain worthwhile,
thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as the LJC-types, there were some other really big name speakers too,
including MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s Chairman &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/speakers/dwight-merriman&#34;&gt;Dwight Merriman&lt;/a&gt;. Highlights for me
were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ken Sipe&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spockframework.org/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; talk. I saw this at GeeCON and that&amp;rsquo;s why &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/tags/spock/&#34;&gt;I started using
Spock&lt;/a&gt; to test the MongoDB Java driver, but it was great to see it again and pick up some extra tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ted Neward&amp;rsquo;s talk at the community night about being a CTO at a startup. It was really interesting,
and nice to see a realistic view of the difficulties of that role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;James Governor&amp;rsquo;s keynote on how Java got its Mojo back. I like seeing facts and figures to back up a viewpoint,
and as you&amp;rsquo;d expect from the founder of an analyst firm, this talk was full of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As James mentioned during his talk, the audience at JAX was, as in previous years, somewhat passive. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure why,
as around 50% of the audience came from outside the UK so we can&amp;rsquo;t even blame English reticence. And in a conference full of
outspoken LJC-types, it seems an odd thing to have an unresponsive audience. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the venue,
the main hall in particular seems to lend itself to sitting quietly in the audience and expecting to be entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented four times at JAX, because, well, on home turf one ends up doing more than one expects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firstly, a tutorial on the new Java driver for MongoDB (more on this later);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secondly, a clinic for novice speakers. This was a lot of fun, and I think it was useful for everyone. I&amp;rsquo;d love to run
this again (I probably will at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/ljcopenconference/&#34;&gt;LJC Open Conference&lt;/a&gt;). The aim
is to give new speakers confidence, not focus on details like building a slide deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thirdly, the third time out for my &amp;ldquo;Design is a Process, not a Document&amp;rdquo; presentation. It&amp;rsquo;s a relatively interactive
presentation, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think worked so well at JAX, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fun presentation to give.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, not only did I get roped into being on the panel for &amp;ldquo;How to start a community&amp;rdquo; at the community night, I ended up, somehow,
moderating it. That was fun, it was the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been a moderator, it&amp;rsquo;s a role I usually avoid as moderators ought to
limit the amount of talking they do, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound fun to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorial materials are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/mongodb-java-tutorial&#34;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
provided a lot of guidance on how to get started online, but the exercises are there, and the slides which present the concepts and
suggest the order to tackle the tests in. If people use these materials, please feel free to give me feedback on them,
but be nice - they were designed for an in-person tutorial, not an online one. But it is a good way to get a feel for the new
MongoDB Java API (in its current, unfinished, state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, JAX London - great speakers, and a good conference to meet not only Londoners, but a lot of international people too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>LinkedIn Etiquette</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/linkedin_etiquette/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/linkedin_etiquette/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;For no reason other than &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; communications are starting to irritate me, here&amp;rsquo;s my personal
LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters.  Not just because I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?),
but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.
It&amp;rsquo;s not about Evil or Good recruiters, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to make it easier for lazy recruiters to spam people I respect
(caveat: there are people who are technically recruiters who I have added into my network, either because I know them personally or because
they have proved their worth).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I get an invite without an introduction message from someone who&amp;rsquo;s name I don&amp;rsquo;t immediately recognise,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to check out that profile to see if we have employers in common or common connections, but usually I won&amp;rsquo;t accept that invitation.
I know LinkedIn makes it easy to click one button and request a connection, but I think my LinkedIn network is valuable and made up of people
I know (even if I only met you once at a conference), and a short introduction reminding me of where I know you from (or why you&amp;rsquo;d like to
connect) is going to help my poor, beleaguered memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Endorsements - almost a total waste of time.  People I have worked with and respect have accidentally endorsed me for things they know
I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked on, simply because LinkedIn makes it too easy to click a button and endorse someone for two things they&amp;rsquo;ve already been
endorsed for and a third thing which, through some LinkedIn magic algorithm, is probably related to what you&amp;rsquo;ve done before and LinkedIn
hopes is only accidentally missing from your profile.  If recommendations were too easy to game (and they were), endorsements are almost
entirely valueless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I do find LinkedIn enormously useful.  I value it more than I think many others do for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It encourages you to keep your CV/resume reasonably up to date.  I personally believe everyone should do this,
not because you might want to hop jobs at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice (although it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to do that), but because a) it&amp;rsquo;s really
difficult to remember what you did over the last 12 months, never mind a longer period - keeping your profile up to date means you can truly
highlight the good stuff you&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, and b) if you&amp;rsquo;ve got nothing to add to your resume from the last 12 months, that&amp;rsquo;s a good sign
that you&amp;rsquo;re not growing and your career needs a bit of love (if you think investing in your career is a Good Thing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s enormously useful for retaining a network of valuable contacts.  This is why, in my opinion,
one needs to be reasonably selective about who one adds to that network.  If you were looking for a new job, for example, and you&amp;rsquo;d been
selective about the recruiters you&amp;rsquo;d added to your network, those would be the first ones you&amp;rsquo;d contact, and you&amp;rsquo;d be reasonably certain of
a quality service.  But regardless of that, because not everyone is constantly job-seeking, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a specific person
(for example, someone comes to interview for your company; or you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a great speaker for your conference/event;
or someone approaches you about a job or an event to go to; or someone randomly e-mails you out of the blue and you&amp;rsquo;re not sure who they are)
and they&amp;rsquo;re either in your network or are connected to someone in your network, you know that you either know them or someone you know knows
them.  That makes them a Real Human and not a spam-bot or someone who wants something from you without giving value in return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not Facebook. Related to point 2, I am happy to add people I know only professionally (i.e. are not yet friends) to LinkedIn.  I&amp;rsquo;m
even happy to add people I don&amp;rsquo;t know personally if they don&amp;rsquo;t fall under rules 1 and 2 in the &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t add you if&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; section.
In Facebook, I have two (main) rules: I have to have met you in person (there are one or two exceptions but those are people I have known
for a long time only over the interwebs); I have to have spoken to you in the last year, or want to speak to you in the next 12 months.
This is for two reasons: 1) I want to keep my Facebook network relatively small so it&amp;rsquo;s more intimate, and therefore 2) I can share more
personal things on there without feeling self conscious or wondering who&amp;rsquo;s going to see it.  I have to be able to speak honestly on Facebook.
On LinkedIn, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be so fussy - I can add you to my network if I like you but you haven&amp;rsquo;t (yet) crossed into friendship; I can
add you if I think I can be useful to you, or you to me; I can add you if I want a way to contact you (or want you to be able to contact me)
but don&amp;rsquo;t have a pressing need to stay in touch frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;rsquo;s an unnecessarily deep dive into my attitude towards LinkedIn.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to change anyone&amp;rsquo;s behaviour, but I feel better for at least explaining why I won&amp;rsquo;t
necessarily add you back - all you need to do is type in the little invitation box to explain why we should be connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I value my connections, and I want to see that you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2013/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2013/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RpASMopn-iA/UnjQz9Tss-I/AAAAAAAAL8c/21JMVGxFuT8/s1600/DSC_1075.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RpASMopn-iA/UnjQz9Tss-I/AAAAAAAAL8c/21JMVGxFuT8/s320/DSC_1075.jpg&#34; width=&#34;211&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, I thought a few months ago that my blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/javazone.html&#34;&gt;would become more of a travel blog&lt;/a&gt; than a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to.  Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&amp;rsquo;d been to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, JavaOne, again, my third year there.  I&amp;rsquo;ll always have a fondness for it - because of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com.es/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, it was the first conference I presented at.  I know people always start with &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not what it used to be&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;why isn&amp;rsquo;t it in the Moscone?&amp;rdquo;.  But not having ever been in the good ol&amp;rsquo; pre-Oracle days, I don&amp;rsquo;t have that to compare it to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do have the previous two years to compare it to, however.  This year, I think the quality of the presentations was much better compared to the previous two years (although I can&amp;rsquo;t accurately speak for last year as I spent the whole time running between my presentations and other LJC presentations).  I learnt something in all the talks I went to this year, in particular:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/524f3d38e4b0c4f11ec57602/about&#34;&gt;Designing with Lambda Expressions in Java&lt;/a&gt; - Venkat doesn&amp;rsquo;t simply cover the syntax of lambdas, but how they encourage us to use different design patterns to those we commonly use. Very informative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/5251c164e4b0a43ac1212459/about&#34;&gt;Lambda: A Peek under the hood&lt;/a&gt; - Brian Goetz goes into detail of how lambdas are actually implemented.  Not something an everyday developer needs to know in order to use them, but extremely useful if you want to understand things like their performance, and why they&amp;rsquo;re not simply syntactic sugar.  Despite thinking I understood this stuff, I still had to watch this twice (once at JavaOne and once at GOTO Aarhus) before I could say I understood it.  Totally worthwhile making the effort.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/524f0463e4b0ab14e307d7bc/about&#34;&gt;Making Java Groovy&lt;/a&gt; - A great, engaging talk about how Groovy and Java can live side by side, and showcasing some of the nice features of Groovy.  I found this particularly helpful now we&amp;rsquo;re using Spock and Gradle, and learnt some new tricks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/5250370ee4b0c4f11ec57641/about&#34;&gt;MongoDB for Hibernate/JPA developers&lt;/a&gt; - Obviously Justin is my colleague, so I should give him a shout out.  But what I like about this talk is that it does what it says on the tin - introduces MongoDB for those of us who are/were used to working with out databases in a particular way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6LKajHbAm6Y/UnjSZ7_2QlI/AAAAAAAAL8o/8XA5AVvEYP4/s1600/DSC_0626.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6LKajHbAm6Y/UnjSZ7_2QlI/AAAAAAAAL8o/8XA5AVvEYP4/s320/DSC_0626.jpg&#34; width=&#34;211&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also liked Martijn &amp;amp; Ben&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=3802&#34;&gt;Lean Startup Ninja&lt;/a&gt; talk, even if they weren&amp;rsquo;t terribly complimentary towards MongoDB.  The talk doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be on Parleys yet, but keep an eye out for it - it&amp;rsquo;s a nice, realistic view of the trials and tribulations of running a startup.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These great sessions were really a bonus for me.  The main reason to go to JavaOne in my opinion is to meet people - it&amp;rsquo;s west-coast, and I don&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to get to California very often.  You see or meet those who are working to advance Java-the-platform and Java-the-language, and there&amp;rsquo;s a big focus on community so you also get to meet as many of the Java User Group leaders as can make it out there.  In addition, there&amp;rsquo;s the folks working hard on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/&#34;&gt;java.net&lt;/a&gt; website and those involved in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;JCP process&lt;/a&gt;, deciding the standards of the language.  Although there&amp;rsquo;s some overlap between all these groups, by spending some time with all of them you get to meet a really wide range of people. You get to hear what people are working on, what&amp;rsquo;s coming down the line, and often get a chance to influence that too by giving your opinions (nicely, of course!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course there&amp;rsquo;s the parties too, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been threatened with being removed from the invite list of the Zero Turnaround party next year since I failed to show up this time.  My favourite was the JCP party - great food, and amazing views of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2MEmpzgCoGE/UnjTq0XVQlI/AAAAAAAAL8w/hiLFac_YcuQ/s1600/DSC_0924.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;262&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2MEmpzgCoGE/UnjTq0XVQlI/AAAAAAAAL8w/hiLFac_YcuQ/s400/DSC_0924.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WVlQ2KcG6xQ/UnjQAnkURoI/AAAAAAAAL8U/G5LjQYrY3Qo/s1600/MongoDB.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WVlQ2KcG6xQ/UnjQAnkURoI/AAAAAAAAL8U/G5LjQYrY3Qo/s400/MongoDB.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some other conference going on at the same time, over in Moscone. Something called Oracle Open World. A few of us snuck over there to take a look at the massive MongoDB stand there (in the heart of Relational-Database-World!).  Open World is a scary place filled with people in suits, looking to sell or be sold to.  It&amp;rsquo;s also massive.  We chatted to our mates there and then ran off to eat burritos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L5YJHRqiYsM/UnjTtx8lgkI/AAAAAAAAL88/2dZrxdLcvMU/s1600/DSC_0935.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L5YJHRqiYsM/UnjTtx8lgkI/AAAAAAAAL88/2dZrxdLcvMU/s400/DSC_0935.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A bunch of us also got a chance to go to the Google offices in San Francisco. We slid on their slide, tried Google Glass, got photos taken in their photo booth, ate their food and drank their drink.  I was pleased to see it wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything like The Internship (a film I tried to watch on the plane on the way over and could not finish - I was really disappointed with the enforcement of industry stereotypes, and the portrayal of elitism.  But maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just me). They also have amazing views of the bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CmZqbfcPgd4/UnjhRjjaxaI/AAAAAAAAL9I/WLlZrYDEITQ/s1600/DSC_0704.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;211&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CmZqbfcPgd4/UnjhRjjaxaI/AAAAAAAAL9I/WLlZrYDEITQ/s320/DSC_0704.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Summary&lt;/b&gt;, JavaOne is as relevant as it ever was.  The themes of this year were definitely Java 8 (lambdas in particular), alternative JVM languages (which now seem to be used enough in mature systems to be viable for more conservative organisations), &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/&#34;&gt;JavaScript on the server&lt;/a&gt;, and as always there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of noise around front end and web, although I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure Java has a really nice, easy way to create a web application.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JavaOne is still the place to go to hear what&amp;rsquo;s in the pipeline, to meet the people working on this pipeline, and to influence the future of Java.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, and I gave a talk:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;290&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; src=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/share.html#play/524f26a3e4b0a43ac1212393&#34; type=&#34;text/html&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; width=&#34;420&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Getting started with the MongoDB Java Driver Tutorial</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/resources/getting_started_with_the_mongodb_java_tutorial/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/resources/getting_started_with_the_mongodb_java_tutorial/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Brief guide to running the MongoDB tutorial from QCon London and JAX London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new work area for this tutorial. For the rest of these instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll refer to it as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve put
mine in &lt;code&gt;~/Documents/workshops/jax&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-mongodb&#34;&gt;Installing MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/downloads&#34;&gt;Download MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; or get it off the USB stick Unzip to an appropriate location,
let&amp;rsquo;s say &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/mongodb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;rsquo;ll have to create the directory for the data to go into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd &amp;lt;location&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And then start MongoDB:&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongod &amp;ndash;dbpath data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now MongoDB should be running on localhost and port 27017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can connect to the shell - this is not necessary for this workshop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: monospace;&#34;&gt;./mongodb/bin/mongo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-your-project&#34;&gt;Creating your project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trishagee/mongodb-java-tutorial&#34;&gt;the Java project&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;location&amp;gt;/java3.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd &amp;lt; location&amp;gt;/java3.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;./gradlew idea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;&lt;code&gt;./gradlew eclipse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open in your favourite IDE and you should be ready to start playing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;m a great believer in getting kids to code early - after all, I&#39;m of that generation that was taught&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/6702297.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;at the age of 9.&amp;nbsp; There are quite a few approaches to teaching today&#39;s kids in an engaging way, but I&#39;m a bit wary of the sandbox solutions that teach kids things like how to navigate a virtual thingie around the screen, or lets them create things in a limited virtual world.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t think kids will easily make the leap between these sort of games to seeing the full potential of programming - they&#39;re too limited and have no context for the kids. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s just another game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Kids need to understand how programming fits into their world, they need to understand the context of coding, if they&#39;re going to fall in love with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/&#34;&gt;Jason Gorman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s comparison of programming to music.&amp;nbsp; Most people learn an instrument because they want to make the sort of music they hear on the radio.&amp;nbsp; But you give them a recorder and teach them to play &#34;snug as a bug in a rug&#34; and they go off the idea entirely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#34;So, is this a sexy tune, Mrs. Badcrumble? I just don’t think, Mrs. Badcrumble, that this is really gonna be a sexy tune.&#34;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065HKFW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00065HKFW&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Eddie Izzard - Definite Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00065HKFW&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Similarly, you give kids a sandbox environment specifically to learn programming for the sake of programming, and they&#39;re not going to see how this turns into Facebook or Google or the apps on their phones.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re going to continue seeing computer programs as something that magicians in a land far, far away made just for them.&amp;nbsp; The same way breakfast cereal is grown in box only for them.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t see programming as something &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;can do, they don&#39;t see the computer as something they can influence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Just the slightest hint, the slightest push, to show them that they can be the magician, that they can have power over this world. That&#39;s the way in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Many of my generation of programmers learnt by coding those godawful choose-your-own adventure games.&amp;nbsp; They weren&#39;t pretty or elegant, but in a single lesson we learnt that a short magic incantation could create something that looked like those games we played.&amp;nbsp; With a bit of persistence we could truly create our &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;adventure, with a story that we created, not just follow someone else&#39;s paths.&amp;nbsp; And then we could inflict that on our little sisters.&amp;nbsp; It was such a short distance from the BBC command line to a game that many of us saw what programming could create, and that programming was something we could do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;There&#39;s an argument these days that computers got so complicated, so elegant, so perfected, that &#34;kids these days&#34; don&#39;t have that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;This is not true.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It&#39;s just not.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t be fooled by this.&amp;nbsp; Sure, PCs in the 1990s made it more tricky to simply program the thing.&amp;nbsp; And IDEs felt, to those of us who learnt from a blinking prompt, like cheating somehow.&amp;nbsp; Or, at the very least, they divorced us from the internals of the machine, provided us with too much separation (what nonsense, by the way - an IDE must be much closer to the command line than&amp;nbsp; BASIC is from ones and zeros).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;But those days are waaay behind us.&amp;nbsp; Several more levels of indirection later, and actually it&#39;s much &lt;i&gt;easier&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to write something that gives the immediate feedback, something that has real context, that will help kids get it.&amp;nbsp; This will help kids see &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re the same as us, they can&#39;t just be expected to do it &lt;i&gt;because,&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;they want to know what&#39;s the point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;And these days it&#39;s easier. You&#39;ve got:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arduino.cc/&#34;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Lego mindstorms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://minecraft.net/&#34;&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; plugins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Android apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;To name but a few. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s not even including the fact that you can get coding web pages and python code pretty quickly and see instant feedback, or even use an IDE to create a UI in something like C#.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The first three items in the list are great for people who are very touchy-feely, who want to see something in the real world.&amp;nbsp; Can you imagine how exciting it would be for your kid to see that they wrote a program that closes the curtains?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a tiny, stupid thing, but you just gave them control of the physical world they live in.&amp;nbsp; Let their imagination do the rest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The other ideas are probably more directly related to the stuff they use the computer for.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re really providing them with a way to customise the tools they already use.&amp;nbsp; Who doesn&#39;t want to imprint a bit of themselves on the virtual world?&amp;nbsp; These sorts of thing let them control a world they understand - in the context of a tool they know (e.g. Facebook), they create a game or a plugin or whatever that works within that world.&amp;nbsp; And they start to see that this tool they use to talk to their friends, this tool that is there to fill their spare time, is something &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;can control.&amp;nbsp; Maybe they&#39;ll start small, but they&#39;ll soon learn that everything they use, everything they touch on the computer, is really only code that some other human has built.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll start to see that the computer-machine is influenceable, that they can tell it to do stuff and it will do it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;That is addictive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;That&#39;s what we want.&amp;nbsp; We want to open their minds to how their world is constructed, and show them that they can influence it. They can control it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;They can change the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;For the rest of 2013, this blog will mostly be masquerading as a travel blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKxlx0E2d_Y/UjQ263mZgoI/AAAAAAAAL3E/QcASu9GHV1g/s1600/2013-09-11+12.03.58.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZKxlx0E2d_Y/UjQ263mZgoI/AAAAAAAAL3E/QcASu9GHV1g/s320/2013-09-11+12.03.58.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;This week I&#39;ve been in Oslo, and I liked it.&amp;nbsp; Actually, you&#39;ll be hard-pushed to find somewhere I&#39;ve visited that I didn&#39;t like in one way or another, but Oslo does make my &#34;definitely going back there&#34; list.&amp;nbsp; If Seville, where I&#39;ve been for the last month, is stuffed full of History, Oslo is overflowing with Geography.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed a pattern in that my favourite places were sunny when I visited them first, which subconsciously prompts me to love them (as a vitamin-D-deprived Englishwoman).&amp;nbsp; Oslo was NOT one of those places, it was overcast and extremely chilly compared to the south of Spain.&amp;nbsp; But the countryside around it is really pretty, and it&#39;s very green and mountainy and watery.&amp;nbsp; Not like Spain, or the UK for that matter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8Z8KXmpKQA/UjQ3BjasABI/AAAAAAAAL3M/lqpZNemtBNs/s1600/TheBayAndCastle.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l8Z8KXmpKQA/UjQ3BjasABI/AAAAAAAAL3M/lqpZNemtBNs/s320/TheBayAndCastle.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I found the Norwegians really friendly, and as with all the Nordic countries their English is better than you&#39;ll find in an international and technically English-speaking city like New York or London (I&#39;m not criticising New York or London, I love their diversity and international-ness, and the fact that London has more active spoken languages than any other city in the world, it&#39;s just the excellent standard of English in somewhere like Oslo is very noticeable).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Anyway, on to the point, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jz13.java.no/&#34;&gt;JavaZone&lt;/a&gt; conference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Over the last two years I&#39;ve been to a lot of conferences, and over the next month or two I&#39;m probably going to double that number.&amp;nbsp; So I didn&#39;t give JavaZone the attention it truly deserved.&amp;nbsp; I was, rather boringly, preparing my talk and doing actual work while I was out in Oslo (and less boringly meeting up with old friends) rather than attending the conference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;However that&#39;s actually a shame, as from what I saw of the conference it was a really nice one.&amp;nbsp; Small enough to run into people you&#39;ve met before or get talking to strangers, big enough to attract some great speakers and exhibitors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dUOZk2Z_lZw/UjQ3x6hh2PI/AAAAAAAAL3c/Elqo9UACsGM/s1600/2013-09-12+14.46.45.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dUOZk2Z_lZw/UjQ3x6hh2PI/AAAAAAAAL3c/Elqo9UACsGM/s320/2013-09-12+14.46.45.jpg&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Oslo Cathedral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The thing that struck me the most though is that it had by far the best exhibition space I&#39;ve seen at a conference.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a result of it being right in the centre of all the rooms, due to the layout of the venue, or if it was simply extremely well designed.&amp;nbsp; What I liked about it was that the stands for the exhibitors were located around the hall and interspersed with different types of seating for attendees to hang out in - cafeteria-style tables; lounge areas; bar-style high tables and stools; bean-bags; space for people to stand and chat.&amp;nbsp; This mix of exhibitor stands and social space made it feel a bit like a party.&amp;nbsp; And while the benefits to the exhibitors are obvious (they can chat really easily to the attendees and hand out freebies), as an attendee it seemed a more relaxed approach and less sales-y than being pounced on by the poor lonely people manning the booths in the sort of exhibitor&#39;s hall where you run through it to get to the food.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Speaking of food, JavaZone had the best approach to food I have seen at a conference.&amp;nbsp; There were loads of hot and cold food tables around the hall, with different types of food, served all day.&amp;nbsp; I spotted Italian, French, Sushi, American, cake, and the ever-lasting burger bar (a dangerous thing indeed).&amp;nbsp; This neatly avoids a lot of issues with &#34;dietary requirements&#34; (vegetarian, gluten free, low-carb etc) and gives us the impression of choice rather than having food foisted on us (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Sorry Oracle but your food situation seriously sucks).&amp;nbsp; Serving it all day avoids massive queues that steal away all your break time, and puts less pressure on you to eat when you &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea how much this set up cost, and I&#39;m pretty sure it wouldn&#39;t work at most venues as they have their own catering arrangements, but it was something that seriously differentiates this conference and venue.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;But my favourite thing about it was the quality of the coffee.&amp;nbsp; Yep, you heard me correctly.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t the great speakers (I didn&#39;t get to see many talks but &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tlberglund&#34;&gt;Tim Berglund&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s talk was excellent, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kensipe&#34;&gt;Ken Sipe&lt;/a&gt; has had a bigger impact on the MongoDB Java Driver than he will ever know).&amp;nbsp; It was the coffee.&amp;nbsp; They had all sorts of different coffee stands dotted around the place.&amp;nbsp; Some sponsored by companies, I guess, and I think the Nespresso-style capsule coffees (that were sadly abandoned because the other stands with baristas were so popular) might have been the default conference coffee.&amp;nbsp; But being able to grab a really good quality cappuccino without having to leave the venue was a very welcome change from the usual conferences, and it keeps you in the exhibition area with everyone else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jHyU7NwU9T4/UjQ3UErSuzI/AAAAAAAAL3U/sjbnzRcyUj8/s1600/TheStage.jpg&#34;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Tim Berglund speaking in the... challenging... room 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Just because if I don&#39;t mention it by now it&#39;s a bit unfair on JavaZone - they had a good proportion of women attendees.&amp;nbsp; Wherever you looked you could see at least one, which is (sadly) a lot better than many conferences.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d estimate it at around 10-15%, which is not bad at all.&amp;nbsp; I wonder if they did anything special, or if that reflects the normal proportions of women techies in Oslo?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;OK so I&#39;m clearly extremely superficial in my appreciation of conferences.&amp;nbsp; Maybe this is the result of having attended quite a few now.&amp;nbsp; But if you go to any Java conference (in particular, but maybe other types of tech conferences too) they&#39;re really focussed on getting great speakers with good presentations (as they should be).&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s the details that will set your conference apart from another.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Of course, location plays a part of it.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re based in Oslo/Norway and a JVM person, JavaZone should clearly be your first choice.&amp;nbsp; But if you&#39;re in Europe and are going to have to fly somewhere to get to a conference anyway, you have quite a lot of choice now, and you might be tempted by this conference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I wonder if one day I&#39;ll be able to do a &#34;definitive guide to this year&#39;s conferences&#34; in advance and be able to suggest the ones you should go to based on different sets of criteria?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention my actual talk at JavaZone, since that was the point of me being there.&amp;nbsp; I unveiled a new talk, although the sharp-eyed amongst you will probably notice that I&#39;ve re-purposed/re-written the &#34;What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility?&#34; talk from this year into a more general why-developers-should-care-about-software-design talk.&amp;nbsp; It turns out this was the perfect conference to do this presentation, as there were quite a few process-ish presentations suggesting that developers should do more than simply learn about technology.&amp;nbsp; These are challenging talks to give at technical conferences - there isn&#39;t always a &#34;process&#34; track, and if there is it&#39;s often not for developers.&amp;nbsp; It is assumed that developers want answers, and tools, and technologies, and often this is true (normal caveats apply around making gross generalisations, but for some developers and some conferences audiences this is true).&amp;nbsp; It was great to be able to give this talk to a good-sized audience of smart techies who, I think, got what I was trying to say.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t really know if I&#39;m preaching to the choir or not though, or what people are really taking home with them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;

Am I just telling you what you know, or did you learn something specific? Or did it re-enforce your own beliefs? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/59769560940/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0-whats-changing&#34;&gt;second in my short series of blogs&lt;/a&gt; about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal.  In it, there&amp;rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; API, or a blend of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The post also shows that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; is prettier than &lt;a href=&#34;http://maven.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;.  Sorry Maven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.  I know it looks a bit like the warnings on your prescription medicine, but it serves the same purpose.  Short version: the driver is not finished yet, and should not be used in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really want to hear your experiences with the driver - it is an open source project and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; is very much driven by the community, we want to hear from you.  But only if you say nice things.  No, seriously, please tell us if you have problems, if functionality is missing, if your tests fail if you start to use it, etc etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go play.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/steveonjava&#34;&gt;Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt;, one of Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/58136652766/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0&#34;&gt;new MongoDB Java driver&lt;/a&gt;, and my plans to Change The World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop.  There&amp;rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&amp;rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/MdOHjGtITjo?list=PLX8CzqL3ArzXMvt5y8VHXKmr8gDC-xOH_&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Life on both sides of the interview table</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring.  Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires.  We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&amp;rsquo;s going through the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/job-interview-tips#.UiBS9_WZJyU.blogger&#34;&gt;Hire Education - Making Interviews Rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny because we talk a lot about hiring at ThoughtWorks (where we both worked, and which has one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.businessinsider.com/hardest-tech-company-job-interviews-2012-8&#34;&gt;toughest interview processes&lt;/a&gt; in the industry) and LMAX, which learnt a lot off ThoughtWorks and shaped its own process for a smaller company that has different goals.  Yet neither of us work at those places now.  Still, we share stories from many of the places we&amp;rsquo;ve worked (or chose not to work), and if there&amp;rsquo;s one take-home point, it&amp;rsquo;s that hiring (and being hired) is not a simple thing to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I&amp;rsquo;ve written a blog post for Somewhere Else.  I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mongodb.org/post/58136652766/the-mongodb-java-driver-3-0&#34;&gt;design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver&lt;/a&gt; in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?).  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&amp;rsquo;m just linking you to them instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.  The talk covers the design goals of the new driver, and this blog post will let you read them in your own time rather than having me fire them at you at 100mph.&lt;/p&gt;

style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I did miss Twitter and Facebook while I was out there, and the WiFi availability was limited. &amp;nbsp;Also, maybe I&#39;m paranoid, but I wasn&#39;t sure how much to trust the WiFi. &amp;nbsp;But I found myself quite pleased to be separated from the interwebs for a bit - it was peaceful and relaxing. &amp;nbsp;I even did more work than I expected, probably because I wasn&#39;t replying to e-mails all the time or thinking of what to tweet next.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conference itself was a weird mix of the familiar with the massively unfamiliar - familiar, because it &lt;i&gt;felt&lt;/i&gt; like a JavaOne - the branding, the badges, the signage. &amp;nbsp;Unfamiliar because I don&#39;t speak Chinese - most of the signs and documentation were in Chinese, and not all the stewards spoke English. &amp;nbsp;The attendees in particular were not expected to speak English (which is totally understandable of course! Conferences should cater for the local population), which made it more difficult to feel like a part of the event. &amp;nbsp;I think I&#39;ve mentioned before that the more I come to these events, the less I feel like an outsider as one of the rare women. &amp;nbsp;But as a blonde-haired European woman I did feel a little... conspicuous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oOKZpQA9aiM/Ufkc24I2QvI/AAAAAAAALoo/KDA5LT4htD8/s1600/DSC_0217.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oOKZpQA9aiM/Ufkc24I2QvI/AAAAAAAALoo/KDA5LT4htD8/s640/DSC_0217.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;It was an Oracle conference. &amp;nbsp;In case you&#39;re not sure.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Oracle probably like the fact that the event is small enough that Open World and JavaOne can be in the same place at the same time, but to me it feels a bit odd. &amp;nbsp;I couldn&#39;t easily find the content that was applicable to me as a Java developer, and I really don&#39;t see much crossover between the two conferences - I can&#39;t see what I, as a developer, would get out of &#34;How to use Oracle blah blah more effectively&#34;.  And I can&#39;t see the suited business types enjoying &#34;Effective Scala&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s less obvious than at the SF conference(s), but there&#39;s a very distinct difference between the JavaOne attendees (emphasis on the casual part of business casual) and the Oracle people (do they sleep in their suits?).  I didn&#39;t envy the latter at all - wearing a full suit and tie in 40°C heat and humidity you could drown in must be extremely uncomfortable.&amp;nbsp;Speaking of clothes, all the women are dressed in summery, pretty clothes (except the business-suited Oracle types), and looked like normal human beings, and the geek guys were wearing less badges of geekness (geek t-shirts, jeans etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did seem to be a great conference to get people from all over Asia and even the antipodes together.  There was buzz in the air, an excitement to be learning stuff and meeting people. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the (relatively) small size of the conference, its youth or its geography, or maybe simply me projecting my excitement at being in a place I&#39;d never been to before, but there was less cynicism than in the western conferences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HnWFwFqbyUs/Ufkc3GqPjCI/AAAAAAAALos/zOoIsSqSzCs/s1600/DSC_0221.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HnWFwFqbyUs/Ufkc3GqPjCI/AAAAAAAALos/zOoIsSqSzCs/s640/DSC_0221.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Awesome to see the LJC get a shout out in China!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In terms of presenting, this was an entirely new experience for me. &amp;nbsp;The slides had all been translated into Chinese&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which I&#39;ve already mentioned I don&#39;t speak, so this meant I had to have my laptop out with my English notes on, as well as the slides on the main screen. &amp;nbsp;I had two remotes, one in each hand, and I advanced both sets of slides at the same time. The fact that the slide on the screen was also on a monitor in front of me made it relatively easy to make sure I had both in sync, but it did require a bit of extra cognitive power. &amp;nbsp;I felt lucky that most of my slides are practically content-less - if my presentations followed the &lt;a href=&#34;http://presentationpatterns.com/glossary/#bullet-riddledcorpse&#34;&gt;Bullet-Riddled Corpse pattern&lt;/a&gt; a) the poor translator would have had to work harder and b) it would have been more difficult to work out which slide I was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RGTON8Wogt0/UfkjPmpqg5I/AAAAAAAALqc/p8bTKu5qiRg/s1600/2013-07-23+16.28.37.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RGTON8Wogt0/UfkjPmpqg5I/AAAAAAAALqc/p8bTKu5qiRg/s640/2013-07-23+16.28.37.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Half of my massive audience&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In addition, my presentation was being interpreted in real time as I spoke. &amp;nbsp;I was worried about the interpreter - I know I speak too fast, and I wasn&#39;t sure if Chinese is one of those languages where it takes more words to say the same thing&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;So I needed to make sure I slowed down, spoke clearly and coherently, and left longer pauses. &amp;nbsp;These are things you should do as a presenter anyway, but it always feels a little unnatural. &amp;nbsp;And in fact the more you present, the easier it is to forget this, especially if you get good feedback on your talks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To deal with both these different things (Chinese slides and real time interpretation), I had to be prepared earlier than normal and I practiced more than normal. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to get the timing right so I would be comfortable slowing down. &amp;nbsp;I wanted it to be 40 minutes (in a 60 minute slot) to give me 10 mins for questions and 10 mins buffer for allowing me to slow down and/or cope with any disasters. &amp;nbsp;I needed to run through with the Chinese slides so there weren&#39;t any nasty surprises.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the end, I thought it went very well. &amp;nbsp;The preparation made me feel much more comfortable and confident. &amp;nbsp;Slowing down had an additional benefit - not everyone opted for the headphones &amp;amp; interpreter, so me not speaking at 100 miles an hour gave them a fighting chance of following along. &amp;nbsp;The audience seemed very reluctant to ask questions in public, so I skipped my usual audience-participation bit, but the fact that I hit 40 minutes exactly gave people loads of time to come up to me afterwards and ask me questions, and I did have quite a big line of people as I was packing up. I think this is a Good Thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fortunately (for me) the session was not recorded in any form, so you won&#39;t be able to see whether it really was any good or not. &amp;nbsp;But here are the slides, in case you speak Chinese (sadly my Keynote to Powerpoint conversion didn&#39;t quite work, so some of the code falls off the bottom).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/24790295&#34; width=&#34;476&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note that my caveats are in Chinese, but the caveats are that the new API for the MongoDB Java driver will almost definitely NOT look like that, it&#39;s just indicative of the direction we were looking in when I wrote that presentation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I was more nervous about this session than recent sessions, I&#39;m really pleased I did it. &amp;nbsp;I highly recommend this to other speakers as a way to force you out of your routine and to think about your presentation style (something we probably all stress about anyway, but this forces you to look carefully at it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Shanghai overall... as you can probably gather from the start of this blog, I liked it a lot. &amp;nbsp;I had a nice, mostly relaxing, fun time there. &amp;nbsp;I loved the modern-ness of it, like the ridiculously fast MagLev that takes a mere 7 minutes to travel the 30km to the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N4uxMHHBqP8/Ufj39c6HFlI/AAAAAAAALnk/LkqJmrUtQYM/s1600/MagLevSpeed.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;90&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N4uxMHHBqP8/Ufj39c6HFlI/AAAAAAAALnk/LkqJmrUtQYM/s320/MagLevSpeed.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The Shanghai MagLev is &#34;the world&#39;s fastest train in regular commercial service&#34;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I liked the alienness, after countless European and American cities. &amp;nbsp;I did not like not being able to speak the language, or the fact that taxi drivers don&#39;t want to take you to the Expo area where our hotel was. &amp;nbsp;I liked the many touches of familiarity and the atmosphere. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d definitely go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WCwgvIYVSPc/Ufk0x8cl66I/AAAAAAAALq8/56LFQqYJwfg/s1600/DSC_0227.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WCwgvIYVSPc/Ufk0x8cl66I/AAAAAAAALq8/56LFQqYJwfg/s640/DSC_0227.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Pollution makes awesome sunsets&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKRXrTupRYE/Ufk0x683cTI/AAAAAAAALrA/QOdN4Mu0rXQ/s1600/DSC_0064.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zKRXrTupRYE/Ufk0x683cTI/AAAAAAAALrA/QOdN4Mu0rXQ/s640/DSC_0064.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And it&#39;s whetted my appetite for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; so I&#39;m really looking forward to San Francisco in September. See you there?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;I was surprised to hear everyone talking about &#34;Chinese&#34; when even in my ignorance I know there are many types of Chinese language, but doing my research I&#39;ve learnt there is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese&#34;&gt;Standard Chinese&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Which makes sense. &amp;nbsp;You learn something new every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;Apparently it&#39;s not&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat&#34;&gt;Your App Makes Me Fat&lt;/a&gt;, I was going to write a blog post about decision fatigue.  It&amp;rsquo;s a topic very close to my heart right now as I try to plan for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/trishas-world-tour-2013.html&#34;&gt;upcoming speaking engagements,&lt;/a&gt; continue working on the new Java driver, try to finish the last couple of blogs on &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spock/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt;, and last but not least plan for moving home this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But since my cognitive resources are at a low point right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave you with a gif instead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://i.minus.com/ibaDjk7AeIcvxv.gif&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://i.minus.com/ibaDjk7AeIcvxv.gif&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;What programming is like&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/spock-is-awesome-seriously-simplified.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spock/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I want to look at stubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stubbing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mocking is great for checking &lt;i&gt;outputs&lt;/i&gt; - in the example in the last post, we&amp;rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the &lt;code&gt;bsonWriter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stubbing is great for faking your &lt;i&gt;inputs&lt;/i&gt; (I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this difference never occurred to me before, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/I+hate+writing+unit+tests%2C+how+come+everybody+else+enjoys+it&#34;&gt;Colin&amp;rsquo;s talk at Devoxx UK&lt;/a&gt; made this really clear to me). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things we need to do in the compatibility layer of the new driver is to wrap all the new style Exceptions that can be thrown by the new architecture layer and turn them into old-style Exceptions, for backwards compatibility purposes.  Sometimes testing the exceptional cases is&amp;hellip; challenging.  So I opted to do this with Spock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/5935645.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;So here we can use a real &lt;code&gt;DB&lt;/code&gt; class, but with a mock &lt;code&gt;Mongo&lt;/code&gt; that will return us a &amp;ldquo;mock&amp;rdquo; &lt;code&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s not actually a mock though, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a stub because we want to tell it how to behave when it&amp;rsquo;s called - in this test, we want to force it to throw an &lt;code&gt;org.mongodb.MongoException&lt;/code&gt; whenever &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; is called.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter to us what get passed in to the execute method (that&amp;rsquo;s what the underscore means on line 16), what matters is that when it gets called it throws the correct type of Exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like before, the &lt;code&gt;when&lt;/code&gt;: section shows the bit we&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to test. In this case, we want to call &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then finally the &lt;code&gt;then:&lt;/code&gt; section asserts that we received the correct sort of Exception.  It&amp;rsquo;s not enormously clear, although I&amp;rsquo;ve kept the full namespace in to try and clarify, but the aim is that any &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;org&lt;/b&gt;.mongodb.MongoException&lt;/code&gt; that gets thrown by the new architecture gets turned into the appropriate &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;com&lt;/b&gt;.mongodb.MongoException&lt;/code&gt;.  We&amp;rsquo;re sort of &amp;ldquo;lucky&amp;rdquo; because the old code is in the wrong package structure, and in the new architecture we&amp;rsquo;ve got a chance to fix this and put stuff into the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&amp;rsquo;d tracked down all the places Exceptions can escape and started writing these sorts of tests to exercise those code paths, not only did I feel more secure that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t break backwards compatibility by leaking the wrong Exceptions, but we also found our test coverage went up - and more importantly, in the &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;happy paths, which are often harder to test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned in the last post that we already did some simple stubbing to help us test the data driver. Why not just keep using that approach?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these stubs end up looking like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/5935655.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Ick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you end up extending them so you can just override the method you&amp;rsquo;re interested in (particularly in the case of forcing a method to throw an exception).  Most irritatingly to me, these stubs live away from the actual tests, so you can&amp;rsquo;t easily see what the expected behaviour is.  In the Spock test, the expected stubbed behaviour is defined on line 16, the call that will provoke it is on line 19 and the code that checks the expectation is on line 22.  It&amp;rsquo;s all within even the smallest monitor&amp;rsquo;s window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So stubbing in Spock is painless.  Next:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/12/spock-data-driven-testing.html&#34;&gt;Data Driven Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver.  Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however.  At the very least, we&amp;rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&amp;rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.0).  Up until recently, we worked hard to eliminate the need for a mocking framework - the driver is not a large application with interacting services, most stuff can be tested either as an integration test or with very simple stubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was working on the serialisation layer - we&amp;rsquo;re making quite big changes to the model for encoding and decoding between &lt;a href=&#34;http://bsonspec.org/&#34;&gt;BSON&lt;/a&gt; and Java, we&amp;rsquo;re hoping this will simplify our lives but also make things a lot easier for the ODMs (Object-Document Mappers) and third party libraries.  At this level, it makes a lot of sense to introduce mocks - I want to ensure particular methods are called on the writer, for example, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to check actual byte values, that&amp;rsquo;s not going to be very helpful for documentation (although there is a level where that is a sensible thing to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmock.codehaus.org/&#34;&gt;JMock&lt;/a&gt; to begin with, it&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for a while, and it gave us what we wanted - a simple mocking framework (I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/mockito/&#34;&gt;Mockito&lt;/a&gt; too, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so used to the failure messages, so I found it really hard to figure out what was wrong when a test failed). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew from my spies at LMAX that there&amp;rsquo;s some &lt;a href=&#34;http://groovy.codehaus.org/&#34;&gt;Groovy&lt;/a&gt; test framework called &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spock/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt; that is awesome, apparently, but I immediately discarded it - I feel very strongly that tests are documentation, and since the users of the Java driver are largely Java developers, I felt like introducing tests in a different language was an added complexity we didn&amp;rsquo;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went to GeeCON, and my ex-colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/IsraKaos&#34;&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; forced me to go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://geecon.org/speakers/ken-sipe&#34;&gt;the talk on Spock&lt;/a&gt;.  And I realised just how wrong I had been.  Far from adding complexity, here was a lovely, descriptive way of writing tests.  It&amp;rsquo;s flexible, and yet structured enough get you thinking in a way that should create good tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we&amp;rsquo;re already using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;gradle&lt;/a&gt;, which is Groovy as well, we decided it was worth a spike to see if Spock would give us any benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the spike I converted a selection of our tests to Spock tests to see what it looks like on a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; codebase.  I had very specific things I wanted to try out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mocking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stubbing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data driven testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the talk I also saw useful annotation like &lt;code&gt;@Requires&lt;/code&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we&amp;rsquo;re going to use, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s made it into a build yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, get this, I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a blog post with Actual Code in.  Yeah, I know, you all thought I was just a poncy evangelist these days and didn&amp;rsquo;t do any real coding any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;First up, Mocking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I said, I have a number of tests checking that encoding of Java objects works the way we expect.   The easiest way to test this is to mock our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/3.0.x/bson/src/main/org/bson/BSONWriter.java&#34;&gt;BSONWriter&lt;/a&gt; class to ensure that the right interactions are happening against it.  This is a nice way to check that when you give an encoder a particular set of data, it gets serialised in the way BSON expects. These tests ended up looking something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/5728846.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;(Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m still learning Spanish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s quite nice, my test checks that given a List of Strings, they get serialised correctly.  What&amp;rsquo;s not great is some of the setup overhead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/5728883.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Obviously some of the things there are going to be ringing some people&amp;rsquo;s alarm bells, but let&amp;rsquo;s assume for a minute that all decisions were taken carefully and that pros and cons were weighed accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mocking concrete classes is not pretty in JMock, just look at that &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re using the &lt;code&gt;JUnitRuleMockery&lt;/code&gt;, which appears to be Best Practice (and means you&amp;rsquo;re less likely to forget the &lt;code&gt;@RunWith(JMock.class)&lt;/code&gt; annotation), but checkstyle hates it - Public Fields Are Bad as we all know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s fine, a small amount of boilerplate for all our tests that involve mocking is an OK price to pay to have some nice tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I converted this test to a Spock test.  Groovy purists will notice that it&amp;rsquo;s still very Java-y, and that&amp;rsquo;s intentional - I want these tests, at least at this stage while we&amp;rsquo;re getting used to it, to be familiar to Java programmers, our main audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/trishagee/5728962.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Some initial observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really simple thing, but I like having the &lt;code&gt;@Subject&lt;/code&gt; annotation on the thing you&amp;rsquo;re testing.  In theory it should be obvious which of your fields or variables is the subject under test, but in practice that&amp;rsquo;s not always true.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although it freaks me out as someone who&amp;rsquo;s been doing Java for the last 15 years, I really like the String for method name - although in this case it&amp;rsquo;s the same as the JMock/JUnit equivalent, it gives a lot more flexibility for describing the purpose of this test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mocking is painless, with a simple call to &lt;code&gt;Mock()&lt;/code&gt;, even though we&amp;rsquo;re still mocking concrete classes (this is done simply by adding &lt;a href=&#34;http://cglib.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;cglib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/objenesis/&#34;&gt;obgenesis&lt;/a&gt; to the dependencies).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; that the phases of Spock (&lt;code&gt;setup: when: then:&lt;/code&gt;) document the different parts of the test while also being the useful magic keywords which tell Spock how to run the test.  I know other frameworks provide this, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been working with JUnit and I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the habit of commenting my steps with &lt;code&gt;//given //when //then&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Groovy, creation of lists is less boiler plate (line 9).  Not a big deal, but just makes it easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got very used to the way expectations are set up in JMock, but I have to say that &lt;code&gt;1 * bsonWriter.blahblahblah()&lt;/code&gt; is much more readable.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love that everything after &lt;code&gt;then:&lt;/code&gt; is an assertion, I think it makes it really clear what you expect to happen after you invoke the thing you&amp;rsquo;re testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So mocking is awesome.  What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/spock-passes-next-test-painless-stubbing.html&#34;&gt;Painless Stubbing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2013/12/spock-data-driven-testing.html&#34;&gt;Data Driven Testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out I know the most efficient routes between work venues and pubs, even in a town that I&#39;ve never been to before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Closing all outstanding&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/pulls&#34;&gt;Java driver pull requests&lt;/a&gt;, except for the one we want to merge but needs to be updated. &amp;nbsp;This is a massive win for us, now we can actually stay on top of them instead of wondering which are valid and which ones we&#39;re actively ignoring. &amp;nbsp;I hope the CTO isn&#39;t peeved I closed one of his from two years ago.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I got my highest scoring day on &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/&#34;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, receiving a &#34;whopping&#34; 67 points in one day. &amp;nbsp;Be nice, I&#39;m quite new to SO - despite being on there for over two years I&#39;m really only just starting to feel comfortable there. &amp;nbsp;One day I might actually &lt;i&gt;ask&lt;/i&gt; a question.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;In all seriousness though, I learnt a LOT this week. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve been with 10gen for about 9 months now, so although I feel like I should be a fully fledged member of the team there&#39;s still a lot I don&#39;t know about. &amp;nbsp;In particular, as I hadn&#39;t used MongoDB before working here, and as I&#39;m head-down on delivering the new Java driver (more to come on that later, I promise), I don&#39;t see a lot of how people actually use the database.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve been lucky because this wasn&#39;t a heavy week for customer support, so I&#39;ve been available to pick up &#34;free&#34; support - basically take a look at questions people are asking on StackOverflow and the MongoDB Google Groups and see if there&#39;s anything I can answer. &amp;nbsp;Obviously I focussed on the Java side as this is the area I&#39;m most comfortable (and there are only a few of us to answer those questions, and plenty of others to pick up more general questions). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So here are my Lessons Learnt:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customers want to be heard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Responsiveness is almost more important to (paying) customers than detailed answers. &amp;nbsp;They want to know that you&#39;ve seen their problem, and you&#39;re on it. &amp;nbsp;So sometimes it&#39;s best to answer a problem with a question or questions, asking for clarification on their situation and explaining any assumptions you have. &amp;nbsp;It turns out that writing that long and detailed explanation of the steps they need to take isn&#39;t really necessary when you&#39;ve figured out what they&#39;re really trying to do and response with &#34;this is going to require production downtime&#34;. Suddenly it&#39;s not as urgent for them to fix this&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Java Ecosystem is alive and well. &amp;nbsp;In fact, it&#39;s a monster...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There really are a &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;remarkable number of libraries/third party apps&lt;/a&gt; that people are using on top of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/getting-started-with-java-driver/#getting-started-with-java-driver&#34;&gt;basic Java driver&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This week, I&#39;ve been trouble-shooting people using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mongodb/morphia?source=c#morphia&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springsource.org/spring-data/mongodb&#34;&gt;Spring Data&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jongo.org/&#34;&gt;Jongo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://grails.org/plugin/mongodb&#34;&gt;Grails GORM&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a lot of people who are using the driver directly. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve learnt a lot about installing and using all these things, as I&#39;ve had to do that to reproduce people&#39;s issues and suggest solutions&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve learnt that some of those things make life quite a lot easier, especially for the happy path of Java developers who simply want to save Java pojos into the DB and query for them afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve also learnt that querying is quite inconsistent across all the libraries, and I&#39;d say the main problem that users have is turning an understandable query from the shell into something that the library they&#39;re using understands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Dates get people every time, particularly in Java.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where is the problem?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Related to the previous point, when a query returns nothing it&#39;s difficult to work out: if you&#39;re using the library incorrectly; if the Java driver doesn&#39;t support various options; or if the database isn&#39;t doing what you expect it to. &amp;nbsp;More often than not the problem is not understanding how to use the tools (and the onus is on us, the library developers, to make it as easy and unsurprising as possible for developers), but sometimes it&#39;s a bug. &amp;nbsp;Tracking down the root of the issue is important, because if it&#39;s a bug we should log it in the correct place, and if it&#39;s working as designed it suggests a lack of documentation or possibly a design flaw.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Having people to help you is dead important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I could have done this from home, from the London office, or &amp;nbsp;even from the beach if I&#39;d wanted to. However, I opted to come to our Dublin office where we have our EMEA support, because I knew that alone I&#39;d try and dodge the work. &amp;nbsp;Not because I don&#39;t want to do it, but because I don&#39;t know our processes, I don&#39;t know if we have a knowledge base I can use, I don&#39;t know if my answers are correct, and so on and so on. &amp;nbsp;When you&#39;re uncertain, sometimes the easiest option is to run away. But when you&#39;re embedded in the team that does this every day, you can ask the stupid questions and get help rather than sit and feel stupid. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s also nice to be part of a daily standup so you can hear what other people are up to, and it puts a (good) subtle pressure on you to do something so you have something to report.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I like about support at 10gen&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve done support before. &amp;nbsp;In fact, during my last year at LMAX I worked out I spent the same amount of time on the production support team as I did working on a team delivering new features. &amp;nbsp;But since I&#39;ve never worked for a product firm before, I haven&#39;t done this sort of support. &amp;nbsp;10gen makes its money by selling support contracts, so not only is it important to keep the SLAs with the paying customers, but it&#39;s also important to provide excellent quality support for them - with any luck they&#39;ll keep paying. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s also important for us to support those who don&#39;t pay - it&#39;s kinda like a teaser of the great quality they&#39;d get if they paid us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the support organisation here is&amp;nbsp;absolutely&amp;nbsp;key to our bottom line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The driver developers (of which I am one) are &#34;strongly encouraged&#34; to do a week of support every three months. &amp;nbsp;We used to do days here and there, but blocking out a whole week to be part of the team, to be excused from your day job, and to leave your e-mail (and sometimes meetings) alone because you&#39;re busy doing support, works really well. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve felt very focussed on the support role during this week, and I&#39;ve been motivated to do a good job. &amp;nbsp;If I had been seconded to the team for a period of weeks, I would have dreaded the whole thing and have plodded along doing my time until my escape. Alternatively, doing it for a day at a time the support issues leak into the day job and the day job is hard to put down during your support hours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve learnt a lot this week. &amp;nbsp;I have been lucky, I&#39;ve had fairly straightforward issues to address and it hasn&#39;t been a busy week. &amp;nbsp;But next time I see the support week looming in my calendar, I won&#39;t fear it as much. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll probably do the next one from home, but my week here in Dublin has prepared me for what&#39;s in store. &amp;nbsp;Most importantly, I&#39;ve got to know the people who are part of my team here, so I&#39;ll be more comfortable asking the stupid questions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing support is so important for developers. &amp;nbsp;Getting an understanding of what your users are doing and what their pain points are can really help drive your design and your architecture, and can really motivate you to fix that stupid bug or write that overdue tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers and support techies can learn off each other - I&#39;ve learnt a LOT off the guys here, but I&#39;ve also been able to answer a few questions about Java in general and the driver in particular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scheduling time in support for developers is a very tricky balance, and probably needs to be experimented with a bit before a company finds something that works for them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Although I&#39;m never really going to &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; being on support, I still like being encouraged to work on support regularly - it&#39;s been so important for my understanding of our product and of our users.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt; I found Grails BY FAR the most difficult to get started with - all I wanted was to write a unit test to prove the issue, and I had to not only create a whole application using the grails command line, but I had to install a whole host of plugins and uninstall all the stuff for hibernate that gets put in there magically. &amp;nbsp;I never did find the solution to the Grails problem I was looking at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;ve never been east of Europe before, very exciting.&lt;br /&gt;August - Going to be in Seville (Spain), and a weekend in Madrid.&lt;br /&gt;11-12th Sept - &lt;a href=&#34;http://jz13.java.no/&#34;&gt;JavaZone&lt;/a&gt;, Oslo, hopefully.&lt;br /&gt;16-20th Sept - Hopefully working from the Palo Alto office, so if there&amp;rsquo;re are any events in Silicon Valley or San Francisco that week, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;22-26 Sept - &lt;a href=&#34;http://javafx.steveonjava.com/congrats-to-the-1st-javaone-invitees/&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;30th Sept - 2nd Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Career%20Advice%20for%20Programmers&#34;&gt;GOTO Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17-18th Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2013/speakers/&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;28-30th Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;December - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yowconference.com.au/index.html&#34;&gt;YOW Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney&lt;/a&gt; - Australia.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Oz, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s that.  The only two other events I&amp;rsquo;m contemplating this year are Devoxx and the London Java Community Open Conference.  I think I&amp;rsquo;m maxed out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to be in Dublin 1st-5th July.  While I&amp;rsquo;m there, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d visit appropriate user groups if there are any.  I can&amp;rsquo;t see a JUG registered on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.java.net/jug-profile-map&#34;&gt;JUG Map&lt;/a&gt;, but I was thinking a city like Dublin must have a few tech meetup groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?  Anyone out there and keen for me to gatecrash their party?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Adjusting to Working Remotely</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/adjusting_to_working_remotely/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/adjusting_to_working_remotely/</guid>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;One of the most obvious differences I faced when I moved from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen
.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; were the working conditions.  I don&#39;t mean like being deep underground in some dangerous situation vs being pampered by
beautiful slave boys and girls.  What I mean is that the working practices at one company necessitated being in the office for core
hours, and at the other flexible hours and remote-working are practically mandatory.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;At at LMAX we
pair-programmed most days, and that meant that being co-located: being in the same office, at the same computer,
was pretty important.  We could work from home when needed, but pairing is pretty tricky when you’re in a different room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The
drivers&#39; team at 10gen, on the other hand, is a very distributed team.  Sure, I&#39;m based in London,
and we have an office here.  But my main Java &#34;pair&#34; is in Boston, working from his home office.  The other driver developers are distributed around the New York, Palo Alto and London offices, with many other working from home in locations like Barcelona, Atlanta, Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although I like coming in to the London office - because there I feel part of the company, and get to hear what other people are up to - it&#39;s really not that important to the day job.  There are only 3 developers based in London, and I&#39;m the only Java dev.  I started working from home a lot more when I figured I could use those 2 hours of commuting for extra coding time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/tales-from-other-side-confessions-of.html&#34;&gt;I&#39;ve worked remotely before&lt;/a&gt; - I was basically the offshore resource for my team when I worked in New York - I could do out-of-hours releases and support.  This was... not the most happy time of my existence as a developer.  Moving to a new city, choosing to live alone, and working from home most days of the week would be suboptimal for many people.  So in the early days of working here I went to the office by default to postpone the inevitable insanity (insert joke here about my current sanity levels).  However, as time has gone on, I&#39;ve spent more and more time working from home: I get more done, the environment is quieter, and because I actually live with two Java developers, I sometimes have more technical help at home than in the physical office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I constantly struggle with the feeling that I&#39;m not productive, that I&#39;m not doing enough.  The thing with pairing is you&#39;re forced to sit down and code.  Not check Facebook, not read your e-mail, not chat to your mates.  Code.  And when you&#39;re stuck, you&#39;ve got someone to talk to about it.  And when you have two or more routes that you think might work, you can decide between you which to take. And if it takes longer than you expected, there are two of you defending that.  I am totally sold on the value of pairing for productivity, in terms of number of quality features delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But.  The benefits to me as an individual of being able to work from home, wherever that home may be, are enormous.  And because of this, a company that embraces this policy can attract all kinds of talent that they would miss if they demanded even as little as one day a week in the office - this limitation still requires your developers to live within commuting distance.  And if you have a distributed team, your all-star team of developers, who may not be located in population density cities, might not require all-star developer salaries. Imagine if you can attract the best talent from all over the world without breaking the bank.  All because you give them what they really want - freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they say, with great power comes great responsibility.  It was a shock to the system to have this level of autonomy.  I&#39;ve worked in various types of company over the 15 years people have paid me to develop code, but nothing prepared me for this.  Sure, you have deadlines, and features, and tasks, and bugs, and support cases. But you also have talks to prepare and blogs to write and tutorials to create and demo applications to code... in fact, there&#39;s so much to do it&#39;s overwhelming.  Being trusted to prioritise accordingly, and to ask for help appropriately, is a real switch from having a prioritised backlog of stories and burndown charts to guilt you into finishing off this story and moving onto the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from skiving off from work when I&#39;m out of the office, I feel more internal pressure to Do A Good Job, to Justify My Existence.  When people aren&#39;t counting bums on seats, they must surely be measuring you some other way, right?  And actually, far from slacking off, one of the big problems with working from home is that you’re constantly on, and drawing a line between work and life is mandatory.  I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lullabot.com/blog/articles/how-working-home-works-us&#34;&gt;really liked this post&lt;/a&gt; as a description of what people have to do in order to be effective working from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I should probably clear up some common misconceptions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working remotely != working from home.  Co-working spaces are popping up all over the place these days, some with perks like free coffee and snacks, usually with lockers to keep your stuff in, and meeting rooms so you don’t have to meet customers or interview people in a coffee shop or shared space.  I visited &lt;a href=&#34;http://workincompany.com/en/&#34;&gt;workINcompany&lt;/a&gt; in Seville last time I was there, and I loved it as a space to create, and get stuff done.  Or you could work in a coffee shop or other establishment (I used to sit in pubs to blog, you’ll not be at all surprised to learn), or maybe you’ll borrow desk space at a friendly company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remote working != distributed team.  Quite a few companies will allow people to work from home (or wherever) one or more days a week, but this still requires them to be able to get into the office regularly, and therefore be within commuting distance.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lullabot.com/blog/articles/yahoo-best-buy-and-telecommuting-advice-distributed-company&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talks about the difference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;As ever, the answer to whether you or your company should embrace distributed working will be “&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/it-depends.html&#34;&gt;it depends&lt;/a&gt;”.  I shall attempt to enumerate some of the pros and cons, and I’d love it if other people could share their experiences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Individual (i.e. you): benefits of being in the office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The quick pint after work - this is how you really get to know your colleagues, and hear the really interesting stuff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overheard conversations that turn out to be relevant to you or what you’re working on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling like part of the company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free food!  Free drink! Birthday cake! (Mileage may vary, depending on your company)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...and the company is paying the heating and electricity&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better desk/computer/monitor(s)/chair/set up (although It Depends, of course).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Individual: downsides of being in the office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(In many offices) distracting and/or noisy.  This does depend though - in a pair programming environment, there’s always a lot of talking, but it was never the same level of distraction as sales guys on the phone right next to you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time to commute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel split - half your life is in the office, half of it is at home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Individual: benefits of being at home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(For some) quiet&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or: you can actually listen to music without headphones - yay!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The flexibility to do stuff that needs doing at home or in your personal life (I can’t believe how many places are still only open 9am-5pm) without compromising your work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can squeeze gym/exercise into your day in the way that works best for you.  This depends, of course - if you’re working with people on the same time zone with the same hours, there’s less flexibility.  But the lack of commute generally gives you a bit more time.  And you can go when you’re blocked, or when you’ve got an hour’s slot between two video conferences that you wouldn’t use for anything else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which leads to: (possibly) flexible hours - in my case, I’m based in Europe but working closely with the east coast, so I could probably work any 8 hours between 8am and 11pm UK time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your own choice of desk/chair/computer/set up - in New York my home office was much more comfortable and productive than the hot-desk in the office&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change where you work - I’m writing this on the sofa, because I wanted to be in a more comfortable and creative place for blogging than my desk, which is associated with coding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More freedom to play and explore the code or new ideas, although this is less about being distributed and more about not pairing every day. Although this could be good for innovation, it&#39;s arguably less good for writing actual useful lines of code.  So this benefit will depend on what your company needs from you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I love being able to cook in my kitchen. I don’t have to grab a sandwich from Pret or whatever, I can have Real Food.  And it costs me less.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the company: benefits of a distributed team: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In theory, being distributed means a company can hire anyone, anywhere. Which means a) you can get really good quality developers - maybe they&#39;re not as effective as they would be if they paired in an agile environment, but if there really is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html&#34;&gt;5-10x improvement for a good developer vs an OK one&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;re still getting a net gain and b) if you are lucky enough to hire people outside of places like NY, London, and Silicon Valley, you can cut costs because you&#39;re paying your really good developers a very good local salary instead of a silly one that pays for silly rents and silly commuting charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Individual: downsides of being at home &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can be MORE distracting - chat, email, errands, babies, dogs, flatmates, XBox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficult to distance yourself from work - there’s the temptation to be always on, to just finish this or just do that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need a good space to work, you can’t sit on the sofa or your bed all day, and not everyone has that spare room or spare space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Individual: downsides of being in a distributed team: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I suspect I&#39;m less productive than I was when I worked onsite, pairing, in an agile team. By productive, I mean lines-of-code-that-go-into-production. Not having people there to help you resolve your internal arguments can result in flip-flapping and going down design dead ends.  Mind you, I do a lot more stuff than just coding these days, so this might be a result of that, and of not pairing, rather than being in a distributed team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I reckon it&#39;s taken me a lot longer to get up to speed on the code, on the product, on our processes. I can ask people when I&#39;m in the office, and of course there’s chat, but nothing beats pairing for getting up to speed extremely quickly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time zone differences - waiting for answers is frustrating for the impatient.  Like me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Text based communication - quite tricky to get the right tone and not inadvertently wind people up&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email. OMGTHEEMAILS!!! When I was in a company that paired every day, we didn’t really use e-mail.  We didn’t have time to read them, let alone write them.  We got up and spoke to the person.  But a distributed team is very e-mail heavy, and I constantly feel like I&#39;m drowning in mail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More meetings - because you can&#39;t just grab people and work ad-hoc, because you can’t have a daily standup in the office, and because it&#39;s important to keep people up to date on what you&#39;re working on, you have loads more meetings or scheduled updates. I have regular meetings almost every day, and I don’t mean standups.  These are necessary because we don’t all sit together and hear what’s going on, but having several hours a week devoted to video conferences is a big change to a place that limited meetings to once a fortnight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No quick-pint-after-work.  Not that I’m an alcoholic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;So stuff that really works for me/us as a distributed team: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chat/IRC.  Indispensable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E-mail for longer, searchable, async communication.  Since our team is spread over Europe and the States (and at some point soon I’m sure we’ll include other continents) you have to remember that not everyone is online at the same time as you.  If you have a bright idea at 9 in the morning in UK-time, it needs to be in the inbox of your colleagues in Palo Alto so they can read it when they start work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google hangout has made it &lt;i&gt;significantly&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;easier to pop into a video conference whenever you need.  Also laptops with built in mics and videos make this easier too, something I didn’t have back in 2008.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira&#34;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;, although I still get so much spam from both I tend to ignore all notifications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular face to face meetings.  I get to go to New York (yay!) to meet with other developers on a fairly regular basis.  And this is really key, face to face is still dead important to humans who haven’t actually evolved as fast as technology has&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Driver days / company kick off - department- and company-wide get-togethers to get to know each other and feel part of something.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still needed: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good remote-pairing tools&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good tools for code review.  As a reviewer, I don’t want to view a patch set with side-by-side differences, I want to be able to see it in an IDE, to navigate it, *and* make comments or changes that the reviewee can see.  As a reviewee, I want it to be as easy as “submit this commit / set of commits for code review”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some sort of good shared whiteboard. I hate not being able to stand up with my pair and whiteboard ideas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I enjoy the freedom of being in a distributed team and working from home, but I actually struggle quite a lot with the autonomy.  It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t motivate myself, if anything it&#39;s the exact opposite - while I&#39;m away from the office, away from people who can &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; I&#39;m working, I feel the need to constantly prove I&#39;m working.  In the office, if your computer or network or software starts freaking out and you spend a whole day fixing these problems, by the time you go home in the evening you feel frustrated you didn&#39;t get any work done, but you don&#39;t feel &lt;i&gt;guilty&lt;/i&gt;.  If your internet dies at home, or you spend the whole day researching the exact git command you need, or your laptop just freaks out for the day, you feel like you should make up all those lost hours and still do your 8 hours of productive coding (or whatever you were supposed to be doing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe that&#39;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember when I first started working as an undergraduate at Ford, the idea of being &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to sit in front of a computer from 9-5 was horrifying.  And really hard too - you couldn&#39;t just get up and take an hour to let things filter through your brain, you had to be seen to be &lt;i&gt;working&lt;/i&gt;, sitting at your desk.  And in these days of internet, sitting at a computer is almost a guarantee you&#39;re NOT working.  Going for a run or drinking coffee in the kitchen and scribbling, or even simply thinking, might be more productive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is that it&#39;s different working remotely. And if you&#39;ve been working in industry for a while, the idea of being self-determined takes a bit of getting used to, whether it&#39;s because you need to learn how to motivate yourself, or because you need to learn to switch off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was chatting to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt; at GeeCON (*clang* gratuitous name drop) and he said Fog Creek and Stack Exchange have distributed teams.  Other than them, us, and Lullabot (the company whose blog I pointed at), I don’t know of many places that really embrace distributed working.  If you have stories to tell, I’d love to hear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS We are &lt;span id=&#34;goog_2060849182&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;looking&lt;span id=&#34;goog_2060849183&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to hire more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/careers/positions/java-engineer-evangelist&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/careers/positions/java-application-engineer&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/careers/positions&#34;&gt;host of others&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;You know how I keep banging on about attracting different types of people into programming?  You know how we say we need to get them young?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1yinSe4_orw/UZzXQoQZr8I/AAAAAAAALkY/HgxArcLwj1Q/s1600/mathematician.jpg&#34;

width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Typical Mathematician?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A little while back I decided to put my money where my mouth was, so I signed up to be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stemnet.org.uk/content/ambassadors&#34;&gt;STEM Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;.  STEMNET is an organisation that aims to inspire children to go into Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths careers, and it does this by creating a network of mentors (people like you and me) and schools.  So schools can publicise the sorts of events they&amp;rsquo;re running, and find mentors in an appropriate field for this event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a STEM Ambassador years ago, when I worked at Ford STEMNET came there looking for people like the graduates to come and talk to kids - STEMNET likes to have a large proportion of their ambassadors close(ish) to the age of the kids, so they grab graduates working in large organisations and apprentices.  Those just starting out in their careers often think they don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot to offer as mentors, but they&amp;rsquo;re wrong - making that transition from education to work is a worrying thing for kids, so speaking to people who have recently done this is dead useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--jyL0hdI850/UZzXQIWZAKI/AAAAAAAALkU/OaFVMinjJck/s1600/engineer.jpg&#34;

width=&#34;268&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Typical Engineer?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I cheated when I was an ambassador the first time - I volunteered at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.shsb.org.uk/&#34;&gt;my old school&lt;/a&gt;, where my parents were also teachers, and helped teach &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tutor2u.net/business/ict/intro_what_is_ict.htm&#34;&gt;ICT&lt;/a&gt; to the boys in year 9.  It was eye-opening for me - ICT is not programming.  Tech-savvy kids were bored and the other kids didn&amp;rsquo;t really know why they needed to learn Powerpoint/Word/Excel.  Personally I thought the Powerpoint lessons were useful - I was working in a large organisation where we were expected to give internal presentations, and had never been taught how to use a presentation tool, despite having various NVQs in IT that taught me all I would ever need to know about Word and Excel (these were very useful qualifications and that knowledge was relevant for many years - and no, this is not sarcasm).  But teaching kids Powerpoint when they&amp;rsquo;re 13 is not useful.  By the time they get to use it their knowledge is rusty and out of date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were taught BASIC programming in my primary school.  And it was basic - &lt;code&gt;20 GOTO 10&lt;/code&gt; stuff.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard.  I mean, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone, but it was fairly easy to get going, and you got the point of it - you told the computer what to do, and it did it.  I think that&amp;rsquo;s what has always appealed to me about programming (insert joke here about programmers preferring computers to people because they do what they&amp;rsquo;re told - if you&amp;rsquo;re not a programmer, then you really don&amp;rsquo;t know how much the computer can rebel against you ever damn step of the way, like a child.  A very stupid child).  I was really struck by Jason Gorman&amp;rsquo;s idea that learning programming was quite a lot like learning music, and he proposed a &lt;a href=&#34;http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=980&#34;&gt;grading system for programmers&lt;/a&gt; similar to that of music.  I can see the similarities between music and programming, certainly in my background - in primary school we were given introductory lessons in both music and programming as a whole class, and those who showed an interest or aptitude for either subject took up lessons at lunchtimes or evenings.  With music, that&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward, many schools have access to at least one music teacher for the usual instruments.  For programming, this is much more difficult.  It&amp;rsquo;s usually a keen teacher who&amp;rsquo;s self taught leading this class.  Which is great, but many schools do not have this keen teacher.  And this keen teacher, should he or she exist, is looking for someone to learn off as well, just like the rest of us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PiUd3wctHFo/UZzXRf_c6lI/AAAAAAAALkk/csUH7zuafck/s1600/scientist.jpg&#34;

are the people the schools are looking for.  We have the experience - years of it.  We have the context for that awkward question &amp;ldquo;but when am I ever going to use this stuff?&amp;rdquo;.  We can show them why it&amp;rsquo;s fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what&amp;rsquo;s in it for us?  Well, it looks great on your CV, of course, and you&amp;rsquo;ll get to network and meet with other professionals, including those in different but overlapping fields.  Kids also have really interesting approaches to problems.  It has been known for groups of children to provide novel answers to problems that have stumped professionals.  And doing something like this is really great for your confidence - if you can speak about what you do in front of a group of children, all staring at you, then speaking in meetings or conferences becomes infinitely easier.  I honestly believe that all the times I spent in a classroom helping out one or other of my parents is the reason I&amp;rsquo;m more relaxed speaking at conferences than I ever thought I would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-klM3xjs-A6w/UZzXR8VKcwI/AAAAAAAALko/cIuVUmMTUkk/s1600/geek.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;199&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-klM3xjs-A6w/UZzXR8VKcwI/AAAAAAAALko/cIuVUmMTUkk/s320/geek.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Typical Technologist?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Sadly, I let my Ambassador status lapse when I got a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job in London, it became so much more difficult to create the time to go into a school, since clearly it needs to be during work hours.  But nearly ten years later, after talk of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/4KIDS/Home&#34;&gt;Devoxx4Kids&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of other initiatives to get kids coding, I decided I needed at least to get my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/overview&#34;&gt;CRB (now DBS) checks&lt;/a&gt; done so I could work with children if the opportunity came up.  If you sign up as an ambassador, STEMNET will sort this out for you for free, which is one of the main reasons I chose to sign up with them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing is the induction - they&amp;rsquo;re not going to let you loose with the kids without providing a bit of help and guidance.  It&amp;rsquo;s only a couple of hours out of your day, and, if nothing else, gives you an opportunity to meet interesting people in other STEM jobs.  On my induction there were surprisingly few IT people (maybe 3-4).  There were various apprentices, structural engineers, dentists, ex-teachers, PhD students and&amp;hellip; oh I&amp;rsquo;ve totally forgotten what everyone did, but it was interesting and sciencey.  And about half of the inductees were women, which enormously surprised me.  I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if programming is lagging well behind the other STEM jobs in terms of women doing the role, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can draw a conclusion based on a group of people who either chose to be mentors or were pushed gently (or not so gently) in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s1600/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RaFaSj1Hmp8/UZzTIAf5HOI/AAAAAAAALkE/U2662Y01VFE/s640/2013-05-21+13.56.09.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The induction covers stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about here - like why you should do this and what teachers, students and ambassadors get out of it - and some basic dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts for working with kids.  Nothing too scary, and even though I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before I found it useful and made me more keen to be involved.  The minimal commitment is one event a year, and this can even be something you&amp;rsquo;ve arranged yourself (like going into your own kids&amp;rsquo; school).  And although I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up for the London area, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily geographically constrained - one of the ideas I liked the most is taking kids for a Skype tour around your office, showing where you work, how you work, etc.  I think that will help blow away some of the preconceptions around programmers anti-socially sitting in their own rooms hacking out lines of code, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice the rather lovely drawings littering this post.  The first exercise we did in the induction was to draw a stereotypical scientist, technologist, engineer, and mathematician.  The point of being an ambassador is to help combat these stereotypes, giving kids real role models to look to, people who can help them see what&amp;rsquo;s out there for them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kids don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to be Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them want to be just like you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>My Summary of GeeCON, Krakow</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_summary_of_geecon_krakow/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_summary_of_geecon_krakow/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.geecon.org/&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt;.  Which was excellent!  I find it really
interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QGi20Kv1QL0/UZyWDc9hzVI/AAAAAAAALj0/ZlJ-1o1rLBk/s1600/2013-05-18+19.35.58.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QGi20Kv1QL0/UZyWDc9hzVI/AAAAAAAALj0/ZlJ-1o1rLBk/s320/2013-05-18+19.35.58.jpg&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
GeeCON had its own distinct personality. &amp;nbsp;If you&#39;re a Java/JVM person based in Poland, I would highly recommend it - more than 90%
of the attendees were Polish (probably the remainder were largely speakers) so this conference is very much for you. &amp;nbsp;The quality
of the speakers was really good too, I learnt a lot off many of them.
&lt;p&gt;From a speaker&amp;rsquo;s point of view, there were some cultural things which took a bit of getting used to. One of the good things was that the
audience was very keen on asking questions, they were much more interactive than a typical London audience (for example). However,
I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to quite short questions, and I found that the audience liked to give a lot of detail in their questions and frequently
ask more than one at once - this meant that all the speakers really needed to allocate a lot more time for Q &amp;amp; A than expected. One
of the other things I found unusual was the number of people who would walk in and out of the room during sessions - this wasn&amp;rsquo;t just
everyone fleeing my session (I hope!), I saw it happen in all the talks, even the keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-stuff&#34;&gt;My stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day I was on a panel about diversity in IT, which was basically about women programmers (again). It was a good panel to be
on, actually, because there were a range of opinions, including downright disagreement, which made for a more interesting discussion.
Sadly it left the audience with too little time to contribute though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day I was presenting &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean, backwards compatibility?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;,
which elicited a lot of responses from the audience.  I think I got the balance right between providing food for thought for any
Java programmer, and enough of a look into what we&amp;rsquo;re considering for the new MongoDB Java driver,
that it felt like I satisfied the two audiences - those who are interested in MongoDB with Java,
and those who&amp;hellip; aren&amp;rsquo;t (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my experience as a speaker which really made GeeCON for me.  For the first time in ages I felt like I learnt
something as an attendee.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that&amp;rsquo;s because a) I only had one presentation to prepare so I had time for a lot of
sessions b) we have some specific problems we&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve on our code right now that we&amp;rsquo;re looking for answers to or c) the
conference inspired it, but I came out of a lot of sessions excited about things to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing&#34;&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first take-away point is to try &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spock/&#34;&gt;Spock&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told for ages that I need to give it a
go, but the session really sold it to me.  It seems to have features that will solve specific things we&amp;rsquo;re looking at right now,
including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplifying mocking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annotating tests with properties (e.g. &lt;code&gt;@Slow&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running the same test with different sets of data, instead of having to copy-paste the test a bunch of times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting of failures, particularly power assert and &lt;code&gt;@Unroll&lt;/code&gt;, make diagnosing failures much simpler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using BDD terms as keywords (given/when/then) means the tests really do document themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m totally sold on it.  I was concerned, because we&amp;rsquo;re writing an open source Java library and I want the unit/integration tests
to be understandable to Java developers, and I worried that adding Groovy tests might make the learning curve steeper.  But I think
it&amp;rsquo;s an idea worth playing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;asynchronous-io&#34;&gt;Asynchronous IO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the things we&amp;rsquo;re working on is trying to figure out the best way to provide an async Java driver. &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.geecon
.org/speakers/erik-onnen&#34;&gt;Erik Onnen&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s talk around performance network programming on the JVM was really interesting.  Most
usefully, it compared sync to async communication, outlining the pros and cons, and how you can do it on the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-the-right-thing-before-you-build-the-thing-right&#34;&gt;Build the right thing before you build the thing right&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first keynote was about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pretotyping.org/&#34;&gt;Pretotyping&lt;/a&gt; - Patrick Copeland from Google was talking
about ideas and innovators, and blowing away the myth that all it takes to make money is a single great idea. He highlighted how
really great ideas aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily successes, and some ideas that sound great don&amp;rsquo;t feel right in practice. Pretotyping is a
way to test things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pgXRSN4oq0k/UZyVTqpUoFI/AAAAAAAALjk/1evlD4F4nYY/s1600/2013-05-15+10.30.13.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right;
margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pgXRSN4oq0k/UZyVTqpUoFI/AAAAAAAALjk/1evlD4F4nYY/s320/2013-05-15+10.30.13.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you use it / do it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you interact with it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it socially acceptable to use it in the
circumstances?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s very low tech, very low effort (think post-its and note pads, not HTML prototypes) it facilitates fast failure (therefore
reducing the cost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session was videoed, so hopefully it will be available to see. If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of An Idea, I highly recommend this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;many-users--anthropology-not-user-experience&#34;&gt;Many users = anthropology, not user experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolksy&lt;/a&gt;, the man who inspired me to start this very blog (well,
earlier incarnations of it) talked about the experiences of growing stack exchange. This was interesting because it was not about
the technology, but about subtle things you can do to influence user&amp;rsquo;s behaviour - for example, reputation rewards &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; behaviour,
and a better reputation means you are trusted to do more on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was another inspiring talk if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in creating a product or company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P-ejmRc3bsg/UZyUtEyArWI/AAAAAAAALjc/qP2tXp-nZkY/s1600/2013-05-18+20.09.07.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;
margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P-ejmRc3bsg/UZyUtEyArWI/AAAAAAAALjc/qP2tXp-nZkY/s400/2013-05-18+20.09.07.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I also met a lot of really interesting people who gave me a lot to think about. I&amp;rsquo;ve come back more motivated than ever to work on my various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Krakow is beautiful, and GeeCON is a good learning experience.  Go next year if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, like one of my presentations, I have a question for you.  Actually, I have more than one question for you.  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using a third party library, why did you choose that over using the Java driver directly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using the Java driver directly, what do you like about it? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re using the Java driver directly, are there any areas that give you pain?  Areas for improvement?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which version of Java are you using?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feel free to leave additional information if you have it.  And this is a public blog, so if you&amp;rsquo;re really mean I&amp;rsquo;ll just delete your comment.  So there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL.  Whether you&amp;rsquo;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&amp;rsquo;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&amp;rsquo;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/nosql/considerations-for-using-nosql-technology-on-your-next-it-project/mh-7167&#34;&gt;watch the presentation for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.  I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, despite promising myself that I would only do one event a month for the rest of this year, looks like I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a bit busier than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what I&amp;rsquo;m up to (or, even better, hoping to see me talk or meet me), here are my confirmed engagements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15-17 May - &lt;a href=&#34;http://2013.geecon.org/conference-day-two&#34;&gt;GeeCon&lt;/a&gt;, Poland&lt;br /&gt;18-20 June - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2013/presentation/A%20Fluent%20API%20for%20Java%20and%20MongoDB&#34;&gt;GOTO Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; - whole day tutorial on the new (unfinished) MongoDB Java driver.&lt;br /&gt;24th June - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stacresearch.com/spring2013LON&#34;&gt;STAC Summit&lt;/a&gt;, London - something MongoDB-shaped (i.e. not Java-specific)&lt;br /&gt;27th June - &lt;a href=&#34;http://thettn.tv/headlines/trisha-gee-27th-june-2013-video.aspx#.UYzlwv35XAE.blogger&#34;&gt;Technology Transformation Network&lt;/a&gt;, London&lt;br /&gt;1-5th July - In Dublin, hoping to talk to a MUG or JUG while I&amp;rsquo;m there.&lt;br /&gt;22-25th July - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/events/apac/cn/en/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; (CON1148). So excited to go to China!&lt;br /&gt;August - Looks like I&amp;rsquo;m going to be in Spain a couple of times (Madrid/Seville).&lt;br /&gt;11-12th Sept - Love to go to JavaZone, Oslo.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;22-26 Sept - &lt;a href=&#34;http://javafx.steveonjava.com/congrats-to-the-1st-javaone-invitees/&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;30th Sept - 2nd Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2013/presentation/Career%20Advice%20for%20Programmers&#34;&gt;GOTO Aarhus&lt;/a&gt; - very pleased I can make it this year!&lt;br /&gt;17-18th Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2013/speakers/&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;28-30th Oct - &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;December - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yowconference.com.au/index.html&#34;&gt;YOW Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney&lt;/a&gt; - Australia.  I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Oz, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve either clicked through those, or you&amp;rsquo;ve already been stalking my talks, you&amp;rsquo;ll see I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually made up my mind what to call this year&amp;rsquo;s main presentation:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design is a process, not an artefact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design is a process, not a document&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is mostly because when I signed up for some of these conferences, I thought I was going to be talking about how hard it was to write backwardly-compatible libraries (which it is).  But when I wrote the presentation, it turned out to be about software design.  And then I found out artefact/artifact can be spelt two ways, ho hum.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure yet if this will actually be the same (but evolving) talk under two different guises, or if they are two subtly different talks.  I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see what I end up writing the week before I&amp;rsquo;m due to present &amp;ldquo;Design is a process, not a document&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How Mechanical Sympathy got me to the airport on time</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_mechanical_sympathy_got_me_to_the_airport_on_time/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Lets talk about mechanical sympathy.  Martin Thompson has been making this term very popular in software development, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/why-mechanical-sympathy.html&#34;&gt;his description of why he used the term&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jUnEWLZmVHI/UWfdyJg6fuI/AAAAAAAALd4/YxbGeiy5Xts/s1600/20130411_162419.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jUnEWLZmVHI/UWfdyJg6fuI/AAAAAAAALd4/YxbGeiy5Xts/s1600/20130411_162419.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I had a perfect example yesterday.  I&amp;rsquo;m about to drive to the airport and the car won&amp;rsquo;t move (I&amp;rsquo;m a modern tomboy, I can write &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/why-customer-isnt-always-right.html&#34;&gt;stories about hair&lt;/a&gt; and stories about cars). Not at all.  It&amp;rsquo;s stuck.  I can&amp;rsquo;t reverse out of my parking space.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The first thing that occurs to me is something is stuck under the car.  Like a cat.  Those buggers hide in the stupidest of places.  So I get out and check there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wedged against the wheels, which seems like the most logical thing that would stop the car moving.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;(OK that&amp;rsquo;s not true.  The first thing that occurs to me is oh-my-god-I&amp;rsquo;m-going-to-miss-my-plane-and-I-haven&amp;rsquo;t-got-a-backup-plan-to-get-to-the-airport-and-I&amp;rsquo;ve-already-paid-for-parking-and-I-would-like-to-cry-now-but-that&amp;rsquo;s-not-going-to-help)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Since there&amp;rsquo;s nothing under the car, the next thing that occurs to me is the handbrake is stuck on - it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s the rear left wheel that won&amp;rsquo;t move, and I know (probably as I had a similar problem on my previous car, my lovely but ancient MX5, or maybe because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen far too much Top Gear) that the handbrake applies to the rear wheels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I also suspect that the handbrake jamming this is the correct answer because I put the car through the car wash on Monday, and the known issue of the brakes jamming on some Volkswagens always manifests in my car after the car wash.  I should probably just let it get dirty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m big on tests, and scientific theory, I test this hypothesis.  I rev the hell out of the car and force it backwards.  OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest - this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a test.  This was a brute force attempt to unjam the handbrake. &lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt; it did provide a suitable test - when I got out of the car to inspect the offending wheel, I could see skid marks on the floor where the wheel had been dragged, rather than rolled, over the tarmac.  Oops.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So my (limited) knowledge of how a car works has provided me with a hypothesis, and reasonable proof that it&amp;rsquo;s correct.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all fine, but I&amp;rsquo;m still not on the way to the airport yet.  How did I fix it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;What do you think I did? Well, I drove it back and forth a view times, hoping the jolting and extreme discomfort of the brake pad against a moving wheel would unlock the brake (from previous experience, the brake clicks off, rather than simply easing off).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t work, and I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to have to replace that tyre much sooner than expected.  Ooops x2.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I sat in the car and pumped the foot brake millions of times - a trick that either inexplicably worked on the MX5, or simply distracted me long enough and the brakes fixed themselves eventually.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;This didn&amp;rsquo;t work, not surprisingly (not the same brakes after all).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Finally, I got out of the car and kicked the wheel a few times.  Hard.  I figured this might jolt the brake back into position.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Then I used my brain.  That&amp;rsquo;s not going to work when you unconsciously put the hand brake &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; when you leave the car to kick the wheel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So I took the brake off, then kicked the wheel.  Hard.  A lot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;And it worked!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;And this is a bit like diagnosing performance problems (no, really).  My basic understanding of how the car was put together, plus some experience with similar problems in the past, gave me guidance on where the issue was and what might be done to fix it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So, what have we learnt today, boys and girls?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A basic understanding of how the hardware works can prevent you calling an expensive expert to do a simple fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always have a backup plan (Disaster Recovery/High Availability - if not hardware, then at least some sort of process).  I was much more stressed because without the car, I had to come up with a whole new transportation plan with a very limited time budget and having no knowledge of or experience with alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I need to drive my car more, because then a) I would have either discovered the problem sooner, or b) it would never have got to that point.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to say that in this tenuous analogy, the equivalent is to do testing in a live-like environment, and actually do DR scenario testing.  Then you know how your hardware and software behaves under abnormal circumstances, and have some concept of how to get back to normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;I did make it to the airport on time, because adding padding to your estimates is a Good Thing and gives you a bit of space for contingencies.  So this story does have a happy ending.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Opq7B-waDrk/UWfgtwufXGI/AAAAAAAALeI/-6nW5tgo7n8/s1600/20130412_102014.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Opq7B-waDrk/UWfgtwufXGI/AAAAAAAALeI/-6nW5tgo7n8/s1600/20130412_102014.jpg&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Here endeth the lesson.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Devoxx UK 2013</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/devoxx_uk_2013/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/devoxx_uk_2013/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all
honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see the back of it
(and I didn&amp;rsquo;t do half as much as some people). Note to self - never speak at a conference you&amp;rsquo;re on the programme committee for,
it&amp;rsquo;s too much work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=90440057274722849&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/download/attachments/6392384/DevoxxUK-2013.jpg?version=1&amp;amp;modificationDate=1364404914960&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/download/attachments/6392384/DevoxxUK-2013.jpg?version=1&amp;amp;modificationDate=1364404914960&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a speaker and attendee though, Devoxx was really brilliant - great speakers, interesting content, awesome friendly atmosphere,
good venue, parties with free drink and good opportunities to speak to people. There were downsides: limited coffee availability,
no free croissants, um&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m really struggling to think of anything else, and none of those are show-stoppers (especially when the
venue is in Islington, so you can step outside and get whatever you want).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All throughout the run up to the conference we
kept hearing it was a conference &amp;ldquo;for developers, by developers&amp;rdquo; until I was nearly sick of it. But it was a mantra that kept us
on track when we were deciding on content, and it really came through on the two days of the conference. Pretty much everyone on
stage was, or had been, a developer, the talks were a good balance between &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo; stuff for our day jobs and &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; stuff for
techies &amp;lt;insert joke about some being &amp;ldquo;useful&amp;rdquo; &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;. The future track excited us with things like like hacking
on the Raspberry Pi, and the rest of the conference had a good mix of Java SE, EE, methodology and Other Stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the highlights were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Kevlin+Henney&#34;&gt;Kevlin Henney&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s keynote, reminding us that Developers Are Human. Who knew?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Sandro+Mancuso&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s walkthrough of OO principals,
and how they apply to us in our actual day jobs. Sandro did a good job of taking quite a dry topic,
that many of us dozed through at university, and showing us why we already use these principals and how understanding them
will make us better programmers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Mazz+Mosley&#34;&gt;Mazz Mosley&lt;/a&gt; had an entertaining talk about the Dark Side of Agile,
walking us through the agile practices in The Government and highlighting many of the unanswered questions that teams have after
switching to agile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Colin+Vipurs&#34;&gt;Colin Vipurs&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s talked about Test Driven Development from the trenches -
he managed to give a good intro for those who might not have done it in practice, but for those who may have been doing it for a while,
this a) was a good reminder of good practice and b) gave a good insight into why we do it. On top of that,
he had solid advice on how to write better tests, that we could all take home with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; gave the talk I was attempting to give at JAX London last
year - what is performance and how do we achieve high performance in Java? Where I failed,
Martin really rocked it.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be leaving that to the professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be rude of me not to mention this point - what a diverse conference! We had developers of all shapes and sizes,
from the suits to the mohawks, of all colours, and (by technical conference standards) lots of women. Watch the video below and I think
you can see it. I was so proud to have been a part of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and meeting everyone. What an awesome conference for networking! Of course, there was a large number of London Java
Community people there (speaking, volunteering, and attending), and quite a few familiar faces from Devoxx Antwerp - it was brilliant to
see them in London. But I was also very pleased to run into people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with in the past, some I haven&amp;rsquo;t see for ages,
and some I still see regularly. And I met dozens of new, interesting people - you guys really made the conference for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was giving my new presentation,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;What Do You Mean, Backwards Compatibility?&lt;/a&gt;. In this talk I share
some of the experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had in helping to develop the new MongoDB Java driver. This is not really a MongoDB talk,
although there are some examples from the new driver, it&amp;rsquo;s more a talk about design, and how we as developers make design decisions
every day, something I don&amp;rsquo;t think we recognise very much. I am hoping to give this presentation a number of times this year,
so if you missed it there will be another opportunity to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, my take-away theme from a conference is probably influenced by the sessions I attended,
so is as much a function of what I think is important right now as it is an indication of what themes are emerging in the industry. But
I came away from Devoxx feeling like there&amp;rsquo;s a desire to focus on the basics - the OO principals that have been around for years; the
good design practices that have been written about many times; and, most of all, a reminder that developers have a difficult job - we
don&amp;rsquo;t simply turn requirements into code, we are constantly doing tricky stuff like system design,
and even trickier stuff like working with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Devoxx UK, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone in feeling a bit empty when it was all over. To re-live a tiny amount of the event,
or get a good feel of what it was like, watch this video by the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/royvanrijn&#34;&gt;Roy van Rijn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/62905094&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/62905094&#34;&gt;Devoxx UK 2013 - Long mellow version&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/royvanrijn&#34;&gt;Roy van Rijn&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all Devoxx events, the talks will be available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/#home&#34;&gt;Parleys&lt;/a&gt;. If you watch nothing else, watch Kevlin&amp;rsquo;s keynote.&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/it_depends/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you hate it when you ask a perfectly good question, and someone comes back with the answer &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating to think that in a world of ones and zeros, people can&amp;rsquo;t give absolute answers and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an answer I&amp;rsquo;ve given so many times, especially when someone asks about performance.  Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my comeuppance.  The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; has been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which Java version are our users, um, using?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do people want an asynchronous driver?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will they want to work with async?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will they want to use async and synchronous method calls from the same application?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do people typically use the Java driver directly, or do they use something that wraps it, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/morphia/&#34;&gt;Morphia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springsource.org/spring-data&#34;&gt;Spring Data&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s most important for users in terms of performance?  Throughput? Latency? Consistent GC profile? Something else?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What sorts of operations are our users doing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do people usually update their driver and the server version at the same time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is it easier for them to update their driver version than their server version?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do they use (or will they need) custom encoders and decoders?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When should we deprecate?  When should we remove deprecated methods?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;hellip;and so on, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a change from the sort of development I&amp;rsquo;m used to: &amp;ldquo;the business&amp;rdquo; (a business analyst, a customer, a business owner) comes to you with a requirement, you ask a bunch of questions, preferably explaining the trade-offs that come with decisions or approaches, and then you and the team come up with a design and implement it.  If you&amp;rsquo;re agile, this is all done in a nice, iterative fashion, which hopefully leads to &amp;ldquo;the business&amp;rdquo; being happy, or at the very least to another series of stories/requirements to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that working on a library, particularly an open source library, is a completely different thing.  We don&amp;rsquo;t even know who our users are.  This statement is true for pretty much any web application, of course, but there at least you can (if you choose) use tools like analytics and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&#34;&gt;A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; to figure out what works for your users and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When your library is used for free by all kinds of different teams and companies, including organisations behind closed doors, you have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s being used, what works, what people like, what people don&amp;rsquo;t like.  The most visible feedback you have is when you see blog posts telling everyone how bad your product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes the design exercise VERY difficult.  Take performance for example.  Having come from a high performance, low latency background, I&amp;rsquo;m desperate to have a very extensive suite of automated performance tests (and we do already have some).  But how do I design those, when I don&amp;rsquo;t know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What operations are typical for our users&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether our users care more about latency or throughput, or mean latency vs the long tail, or GC pauses, etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How much data customers tend to punt around&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What the hardware or network topology looks like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one lesson you learn when performance testing is to make your test environment as similar to production as possible.  How can we do that for all our customers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we can&amp;rsquo;t.  Of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we can do is offer an easy way for our users to test it for themselves, with their own data, their own hardware, their own use-cases.  If we can provide some sort of hook into standard metrics, we could get users to plug into that and do what they needed.  In theory, as we get more examples of these standard metrics from a range of users, it will be easier for us to help them diagnose problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered thinking about this problem is that I was asking the wrong question - it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;how do we test this?&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;how do we make it as easy as possible for users to test this in a production-like environment?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest headache has been backwards compatibility.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on plenty of systems where we&amp;rsquo;ve provided an API which has to be maintained in a friendly way for those who use it.  That&amp;rsquo;s tough enough - you have to be careful to only add methods, not to change signatures or remove them altogether.  But when your system is not simply an API to code against, but a library that runs within other people&amp;rsquo;s systems, this problem is even harder.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Parallel%20KEYNOTE:%208%20Lines%20of%20Code%20-%20Fleming%20Room%203rd%20Floor&#34;&gt;Greg Young talked at QCon&lt;/a&gt; about this problem from the developer&amp;rsquo;s point of view - every piece of code in your system, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a third party library, is your code.  Because you&amp;rsquo;re the one who&amp;rsquo;ll get called at three in the morning if your system falls over with a ConcurrentModificationException in some third party data structure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as library developers, we have to not only provide excellent quality, well tested code, but we also have to let our baby go off and run in strange environments.  Ones that might not be running Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java 1.7, ones that might contain other libraries that could clash with our own.  Have you ever looked at all the Maven dependencies in a large project?  You can end up with conflicting versions of common libraries (e.g. logging or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection&#34;&gt;DI&lt;/a&gt; frameworks) as every library you use pulls in dozens of libraries for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our case then, we need to use as few dependencies as possible, and to write nice, clean, modern Java, whilst supporting older versions of Java.  What&amp;rsquo;s modern enough?  We know that some large organisations take a loooong time to upgrade to the latest versions of Java.  We currently support Java 5 and above, as 5 was a big enough change (and is old enough now) to be a good point to draw the line.  But what about Java 7, with its shiny new &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/package-summary.html&#34;&gt;asynchronous channels&lt;/a&gt;?  That would be awesome for a driver like ours, an application that exists solely to connect to some server somewhere.  What about Java 8, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/java-8-introduction-to-lambdas-article.html&#34;&gt;lambda goodness&lt;/a&gt; and a very appealing &lt;a href=&#34;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/sotc3.html&#34;&gt;Stream interface&lt;/a&gt;, that supports (and encourages) a syntax that looks like it might work well for providing a fluent API for querying, I dunno, databases?  How do we make the most out of advances in modern Java, without alienating our existing users?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even talked about actually changing the API.  The existing Java driver doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make use of generics.  How can we change our API to provide a more modern-looking interface, without either forcing all our users to make massive changes to their applications (and for what?  Their code already works), or adding so many new classes and methods that it becomes very difficult for new users to work out the Best Practice way of interacting with our driver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what can we do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firstly we have to figure out which questions we have and what possible solutions exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then we have to weigh up the pros and cons of each of the possible solutions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ideally we&amp;rsquo;d get feedback early and often from our users, from the community, about the approaches we&amp;rsquo;re taking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development would happen in parallel, in a nice, agile, way, to bring the best possible solution for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this all really means, though, is that the Shiny New Java Driver™ is not ready right now, and will not be ready immediately, despite the fact that we&amp;rsquo;ve already spent some time on its development, and considered all of those questions and more.  Right now, we&amp;rsquo;re starting to get feedback from the community - from users, and from committers (or people who would like to be committers).  Which means that I get to to go to more conferences and user groups, and talk about our problems when designing the new driver.  I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get two things out of this, apart from more air miles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feedback from the community about our assumptions and the direction we&amp;rsquo;re taking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Present to the development community some of the lessons we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt/are learning, in the hope that you can use them when approaching the design of your own applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;lt;gratuitous-conference-plug&amp;gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve already seen some of these &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/upcoming-events.html&#34;&gt;upcoming events&lt;/a&gt;.  But in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/109032992/&#34;&gt;this Thursday I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting at Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt; on how we approached this design problem, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/What+do+you+mean%2C+backwards+compatibility&#34;&gt;again at DevoxxUK next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re more interested in everything MongoDB, and want to get a much better look at what it is, how it works, how to design for it, then come to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-london-2013&#34;&gt;MongoDB London&lt;/a&gt;, where I am one of numerous presenters, all going into MongoDB specifics.&amp;lt;/gratuitous-conference-plug&amp;gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m afraid to say that even after this long post, even after bemoaning my own experiences of hearing &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;, I still don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But maybe I do.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;quot;It Depends&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;you need to get more information in order to answer that question&amp;rdquo;.  And it&amp;rsquo;s our job as developers to ask the right questions to gather that information.  If the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re not asking the right question yet, or you&amp;rsquo;re not asking the right people.  So dig down, find out why you can&amp;rsquo;t answer the original question, and start iterating through your design process until you have answers that you can act upon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy.  Right&amp;hellip;?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was flattered a couple of weeks ago to be interviewed by Google as part of their women techmaker&amp;rsquo;s series,
as it moves over to Europe.  In this video I talk about going to Mars, education, planning your career, being a developer,
and the impact of technology on our lives.  So, not much&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I like QCon London, I really do.  Not only is it on home turf, but, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;as I&amp;rsquo;ve said before&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just focus on technology, or a set of technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s1600/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t0Q7ewOcjVk/UTfM32qZNcI/AAAAAAAALZ4/Hg0KDsMxPqA/s640/2013-03-05+16.35.12.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in planning QCon this year.  So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this.  And it&amp;rsquo;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&amp;rsquo;ve helped build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are things I took out of today that I want to get down on &amp;ldquo;paper&amp;rdquo; now, because I think the next few days will have different themes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Not Forget About Computer Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased to see this in a conference!  After documenting and talking about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; so much last year, I felt it was important for us to go back to our roots a bit, and have some &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Mechanical Sympathy&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of the sessions today brought us back to the school room and had us thinking about the tools we&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my new role I&amp;rsquo;m doing something I&amp;rsquo;ve never had to do before, and that&amp;rsquo;s writing a library that will be used by other developers.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Barbara+Liskov&#34;&gt;Barbara Liskov&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; keynote had me thinking hard about &amp;ldquo;readability over writability&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;design for the case that is used most often&amp;rdquo;.  I also came out slightly depressed that some things hadn&amp;rsquo;t changed in 40 years.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; talk made me wish I had written my driver performance tests up front, and poked me to continue thinking about our users&amp;rsquo; performance needs.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to say &lt;a href=&#34;http://damian.conway.org/About_us/Bio_formal.html&#34;&gt;Damian Conway&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; keynote made me want to code in Latin, but in fact it motivated me to get back to learning Spanish.  But it also (unintentionally) backed up a point I&amp;rsquo;ve heard before, which is that programming is at least twice as hard to learn if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak English.  Probably worse if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak a European language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the message I took from the combination of these sessions is that it&amp;rsquo;s almost more important than ever to get back to basics.  Stop obsessing about frameworks and tools and different flavoured JVM languages.  Start remembering all these things are tools, that they run on machines that work with ones and zeros.  Whatever abstractions we&amp;rsquo;re using, we will write better, cleaner, more performant, fit-for-purpose code if we understand our tools, and their strengths and weaknesses.  One of these tools is even our own brain - understand how it shapes the information and presents us with solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Art Is Awesome (and Useful)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went a bit off topic to go to two sessions on visual information.  My excuse is that this blog needs more pictures, and I want more visual ways of representing what&amp;rsquo;s going on with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;/the driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s1600/Notes+5+(page+1).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aG1cjS5pg1A/UTfWgtAGD3I/AAAAAAAALaI/SFUo828A-DU/s400/Notes+5+(page+1).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/speaker/Heather+Willems&#34;&gt;Heather Willem&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; session encouraged us to doodle throughout.  In fact, forced us to.  Right up front she adresses the fact that doodling is seen as a lack of attention, as a waste of time.  And I realised, sitting there in the audience with my iPad and stylus, that I did feel guilty drawing away while someone talked at me.  But it was a brilliant exercise in unblocking some of those creative juices, and letting us see the power in visual information.  Perfect is not important, pictures are powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s1600/Notes+5+(page+2).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wLTnBK3ghYc/UTfKjTqIYSI/AAAAAAAALZo/uHIDDa-gxn4/s400/Notes+5+(page+2).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fernando Orellana is an artist fascinated by building machines to create art.  It was awesome to see an artist who also builds robots and codes stuff to do what he wants.  He said &amp;ldquo;code is like paint, I use it to create&amp;rdquo;.  See? I &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; coding was a creative activity.  He&amp;rsquo;s done some stuff that I probably would have been tempted to say &amp;ldquo;is that art?&amp;rdquo;, like aiming to create &lt;a href=&#34;http://fernandoorellana.com/projects/extruder/&#34;&gt;40 000 play doh cars&lt;/a&gt;.  Or making creepy rodents that live in &amp;ldquo;dumb little suburban homes&amp;rdquo; out of singing hamster toys.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://fernandoorellana.com/&#34;&gt;Go to his website&lt;/a&gt; and watch the videos, nothing else can describe it.  I was blown away, it was inspiring.  And useful too for sparking creativity in all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s1600/Notes+5+(page+14).png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;331&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iZxEdZOP1k4/UTfKqXejghI/AAAAAAAALZw/epR56z099yQ/s400/Notes+5+(page+14).png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my &amp;ldquo;subconscious drawing&amp;rdquo; from the start of the session.  We need more child-like art in our lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two sessions really rekindled my desire to do arty, drawing-y creative stuff.  And helped me see how fear blocks many of us from using this medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting in the audience as an attendee, different things jump out at you.  I was shocked, as someone who&amp;rsquo;s been involved in suggesting and selecting speakers, at how few women there were again on this first day.  My thought was, how could this happen with me on the committee??  So I have more sympathy for conference organisers than I did, when facing this tough problem, but more conviction than ever that we need to do something different to showcase different types of role models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it might be my imagination or wishful thinking, but the overall diversity of the attendees seemed much greater than recent years, which is a Good Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for bringing up this subject again, but you might consider it blind of me not to notice something in a conference I&amp;rsquo;ve actually worked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;But overall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been really impressed with the first day of the conference.  Not only was it, of course, a great opportunity to meet new people, catch up with old friends, and generally network, the sessions that I went to were excellent, and have me excited to be working in this industry, at this time.  And to be in a position to hear about it all.  And maybe, just maybe, contribute something of my own.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Staying Ahead of the Curve</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting discussion last night at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; developer sessions, and
it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that comes up again and again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I stay ahead of the curve?  There are so many technologies out there, and more coming along, I can&amp;rsquo;t even keep up with Java,
let alone the other JVM languages, HTML5, JavaScript frameworks, NoSQL, Big Data&amp;hellip;. argh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology, particularly development, seems to move at an ever-increasing pace.  Sure, the Internet makes it a lot easier for us to get
access to information than in the Olden Days, when people probably had to read papers and books,
and physically meet up to share knowledge, but that just makes the sheer volume of information even more overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; you keep on top of all those technologies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t.  If you devoted yourself to learning the same way you did at university (pfff, well,
theoretically you devoted yourself to learning&amp;hellip;), you could still never master every technology out there,
and every new language and framework that pops up daily.  Even people who pick a technology stack that&amp;rsquo;s suitable for purpose (let&amp;rsquo;s go
with the old favourite Spring/Hibernate combo) can&amp;rsquo;t read every blog post about those technologies and see every conference talk that
was ever videoed.  To be the best even at Just Java, you&amp;rsquo;d have to be a master of concurrency, understand garbage collection,
have read all revisions of
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321356683/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321356683&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Effective Java&lt;/a&gt;,
know every detail of all versions of Java, including all the changes coming in &lt;a href=&#34;http://jdk8.java.net/&#34;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt;,
be aware of all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/jsr/stage?listBy=jsr&#34;&gt;JSRs&lt;/a&gt; in progress.  They&amp;rsquo;d have to have read about waterfall development,
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201835959/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0201835959&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Mythical Man-Month&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321278658&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0130676349/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0130676349&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt;, Lean, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Leaner-Programmer-Anarchy&#34;&gt;Programmer Anarchy&lt;/a&gt;,
so that they could know they are working in the most effective way for the business and team they are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that as well as working 40 hours a week on the day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to expect to know the ins and out of all current (and maybe dated) technologies, and all upcoming ones - not knowing which are just
fads and which are going to be the Next Big Thing - is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t you ask candidates how they stay current when you interview them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I do. And actually it&amp;rsquo;s their willingness to at least try, and their ability to filter out and select the things to investigate or be
aware of that interests me, not their deep understanding of Scala when they&amp;rsquo;re working in a Java EE environment (for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons that I can think of to &amp;ldquo;stay ahead of the curve&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be more effective in your job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get your next job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for point one, it&amp;rsquo;s a little easier to filter out the noise and focus on what&amp;rsquo;s relevant.  In your place of work,
there are going to be hard limits on new stuff you can use.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your systems guys will not allow new languages, even JVM ones, in a production environment.  In which case,
you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about learning them in any detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your company has paid a heavy subscription fee for their existing database, therefore they will not be trying out funky
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/nosql_is_a_stupid_name/&#34;&gt;NoSQL&lt;/a&gt; solutions.  Fine, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to research them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re working on a messaging system with no UI.  In which case, you can let the new JavaScript frameworks rise and fall without
worrying too much about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You work for a consultancy that specialises in government work, and documentation is sacred.  So,
don&amp;rsquo;t worry about going to a bunch of agile/lean conferences, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t be able to sell it to your customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m not saying these circumstances apply to everyone. And I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting these are necessarily the best situations to be in.&lt;br&gt;
But you can look at your current position and, if you intend to stay there, it might rule out a lot of the technology/process learning
that&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point one suggests good places for research.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re using Spring dependency injection and you don&amp;rsquo;t speak XML fluently.  So you might research Spring wired up via Java and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.springsource.org/2007/05/14/annotation-driven-dependency-injection-in-spring-21/&#34;&gt;annotations&lt;/a&gt;, or you might look at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/&#34;&gt;Guice&lt;/a&gt;, or you might do a bit more reading around good practises in XML, or tools you
can add to your IDE to make your life easier (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eclipse.org/&#34;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/xml_editor.html&#34;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt; both support XML refactoring).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &lt;a href=&#34;http://ant.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; scripts are killing you, and you don&amp;rsquo;t know where your library jars should live.  You could read a
lot more about Ant, you might look into &lt;a href=&#34;http://maven.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Maven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ant.apache.org/ivy/&#34;&gt;Ivy&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt; (hint - gradle is awesome if you don&amp;rsquo;t like programming in XML).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend all your time coercing objects into something &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hibernate.org/&#34;&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt;-shaped,
and not actually delivering new functionality.  Maybe you could become a Hibernate guru instead of just poking at it like most of us do,
or you could investigate different persistence frameworks or mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea.  If you feel pressured to keep learning and you&amp;rsquo;re not looking for a new job, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty you can be doing within
the framework of your day job.  The best thing about this is that you might even be able to persuade your boss that you need to do some
or all of this learning on work time, leaving you more time for your kids/spouse/drinking/XBox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really much more motivated to learn skills to find that great new job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point two is a bit more tricky.  When you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new job, it seems like every job description contains all technologies under
the sun; it seems like interviewers expect you to be an expert in all sorts of different areas; it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to tell which jobs are
good and which are poor, so you apply for everything and try to learn everything to get to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;rsquo;re already at the applying-for-a-new-job stage, you might not actually have time to learn everything under the sun.  And if
you&amp;rsquo;re still working at the current place and just looking around to see what&amp;rsquo;s out there, you might not have time to train yourself up
on all those great new JavaScript frameworks while doing the day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How on earth do you pick which things to focus on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly easy.  Just pick the ones that interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if I&amp;rsquo;m falling behind on technology X and it turns out to be The Next Big Thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, by the time it becomes the next big thing, you&amp;rsquo;ll have heard enough about it to know whether or not you care  - either because it
interests you or because it&amp;rsquo;s so big you should care.  And by then, there will be plenty of knowledge out there (blogs,
courses. conferences, books&amp;hellip;) so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to pick it up much easier than when it was at the embryonic stage and no-one really
knew what to use it for. Java is, what, 17 years old now, and people are still starting to learn it now.  No-one said you had to have
coded with Java 1.0 in order to be effective in a Java 8 lambdas world.  In fact, you could argue that those who learnt it early on
might be less able to adjust to the current state of play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.  Learn something because it interests you, or it&amp;rsquo;s fun, or you personally can see the value of it. Even the process of learning
something new is valuable, even if the thing you learnt is not - it exercises those brain-muscles so they&amp;rsquo;re used to picking up
something unfamiliar and playing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I see a thousand jobs for Scala/HTML5/&amp;lt;insert tech here&amp;gt;! Should I learn that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you looked at Scala?  Do you like it?  Do you want to learn a whole new language?  Do you want to spend the next two years of your
career working in Scala?  Because if you learn it to find a new job, and you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find a new Scala job,
then you&amp;rsquo;re going to &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to use it, and to continue to learn it. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t really give a crap about Scala,
then why bother?  Have you looked at the types of companies that are advertising jobs for Scala?  Do you want to work there?  Again,
if not, don&amp;rsquo;t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our industry, particularly if you live and work in places like London, New York, Silicon Valley, there are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of jobs,
even in these Tough Economic Times.  You don&amp;rsquo;t need to take any old job (unless you need a job Right Now,
in which case I would advise you take Any Old Job and work on the side to find The Right Job to move to imminently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, you&amp;rsquo;re freaking out because there are all these different technologies and all these jobs that are looking for different
combinations of all these different skills, and this is a Good Thing.  You&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at it wrong - you think you need to be
everything anyone wants, so that someone out there will pick you, like some sort of school sports team selection.  But it&amp;rsquo;s not like
that - the selection power is in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; hands.  You can wade through those millions of job postings and find the ones that interest
you.  You can invest in becoming skilled at the things you like, the things you enjoy, the things that scratch your intellectual itch,
and you can then find a job that matches those skills.  Even better, if you&amp;rsquo;re active in learning those skills,
and visible at it (stack overflow, your blog, communities&amp;hellip;), you&amp;rsquo;re going to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://java.dzone.com/articles/ghost-who-codes-how-anonymity&#34;&gt;improve your chance of getting a job&lt;/a&gt; in the area that fascinates you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be good at everything.  Just find the things that interest you, stuff you feel motivated to learn about,
and then when you find a job that uses those skills, you know you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in fact, there is only one reason to stay ahead of the curve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because you want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to figure out what to spend time learning and what to ignore for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to stay ahead of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the curves.  You just have to stay within tolerance of your own curve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Upcoming Events (and Trisha Freaks Out A Bit)</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_events_and_trisha_freaks_out_a_bit/</link>

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_events_and_trisha_freaks_out_a_bit/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;My next few talks are where I finally start speaking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.  After 4 months working for 10gen, I still feel completely under-qualified to speak with any authority on the subject.  It&amp;rsquo;s very different joining a company with an established and growing product, to joining a very young company and being in on the development since practically day one.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on designing the Brand New Java Driver, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this stage, the new driver is still very much a prototype, and we have a lot of ideas to explore, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about things like design considerations, and the process of developing the driver, more than definitive guides on how to use it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve found working on a library very different to working on a platform or internal application.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;19th Feb - London MUG: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/London-MongoDB-User-Group/events/100991642/&#34;&gt;Into to the new Java driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5th March - QCon: Tutorial (well, more like hack-session) on &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/World%20Premier%20-%20Coding%20Against%20MongoDB%20with%20the%20New%20Java%20Driver&#34;&gt;the new MongoDB Java driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8th March - QCon: &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Hire%20Education%20-%20making%20interviews%20rock&#34;&gt;Making Interviews Rock&lt;/a&gt; (with Dan North)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;14th March - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt;: How to give technical presentations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;21st March - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt;: Possible speaking slot (TBC)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;26-27th March - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Devoxxians?atl_token=7zFhyIovV0&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;: Talk TBC&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18-20th June - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2013/speakers/&#34;&gt;GOTO Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; (maybe!!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Looking at that list inspires a number of different emotions:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fear&lt;/b&gt;.  OMGIhaven&amp;rsquo;twrittenanyofthosetalksyetandthey&amp;rsquo;reallgoingtobeterrible.  Also OMGIsignedupforfivetalksinMarchalonewhatiswrongwithme?  And OMGhowcanIgiveatalkongivinggreattalkswhatifthattalkisterriblenoonewilleverlistentomeagain.  Etc etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pride&lt;/b&gt; (in a good way).  Last year, QCon London was the first solo presentation I gave at a conference.  This year I&amp;rsquo;ve had to turn down more conferences than I even spoke at last year, and I&amp;rsquo;m being encouraged to talk on a range of subjects that interest me.  I miss the comfort of presenting on the Disruptor, a subject I got to know very well, but the variety is fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Astonishment&lt;/b&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m presenting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tastapod&#34;&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt;.  And it was his idea.  He wants to be on stage with me and co-present with me.  This is mental, Dan&amp;rsquo;s pretty much a role model for me (don&amp;rsquo;t tell him I said that) and it&amp;rsquo;s crazy to be doing something together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now I tell you all this not to share with you my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FirstWorldProblems&amp;amp;src=hash&#34;&gt;#FirstWorldProblems&lt;/a&gt;, some sort of desperate bid for sympathy (although I&amp;rsquo;m always blown away by the nice things people say to me when they think I need encouragement).  But because people keep telling me again and again how they could never do public speaking, how I&amp;rsquo;m so lucky it doesn&amp;rsquo;t scare me, how they have nothing to say that anyone will want to hear.  And they&amp;rsquo;re wrong, because I&amp;rsquo;m not lucky.  I&amp;rsquo;m stubborn.  It does scare me, especially new material that people might not like.  But it can be fun, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth pushing through the (very understandable) reluctance in order to get the payoff from the times it does work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway enough of the moralising.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As well as the speaking gigs, I&amp;rsquo;ve also got some interesting interviews lined up, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to write a lot of stuff for various publications.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to say that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m not blogging, but since I haven&amp;rsquo;t started writing those yet either&amp;hellip;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As I constantly talk about in my how-to-get-more-women-into-technology talks, we, the developers, the people who do this job,
need to get out there and tell people what&amp;rsquo;s so great about what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the initiatives you can get involved in are collected here. Please mail me or get me on twitter (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/trisha_gee&#34;&gt;@trisha_gee&lt;/a&gt;) if you want to add
anything to this list:&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As well as talking about, you know, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/agile-when-agile-goes-well.html&#34;&gt;actual work-type-stuff&lt;/a&gt;, I was encouraged to give my &amp;ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&amp;rdquo; presentation at Devoxx.  This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top.  Also, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was incredibly impressed with the audience.  There were literally hundreds of people, most of them men.  To me, it proved once again that the men in this industry are determined to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; this problem of gender imbalance.  And they&amp;rsquo;re happy to extend that to improving diversity as a whole, once you highlight the bigger problem.  It says to me that this is not naturally a misogynistic industry, where you have to fight against the boys club to get anywhere.  It says to me that we are all in this together.  After all, in the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; world the geeks are still outsiders, and different, so we&amp;rsquo;re used to embracing our different-ness - whether that&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re the only girl in the room, the only Java developer at a .NET conference, or the only techy at a dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conferences are a self-selecting audience, I know - these are the people who are investing time and money in advancing their careers, or at least encouraging their employers to do.  But for the punchline of this session, these are exactly the right people.  We need to go out, tell everyone how much we enjoy our jobs; tell kids that programming is cool, and &lt;i&gt;show&lt;/i&gt; them it&amp;rsquo;s fun; mentor other people, and each other, and be a role model.  I don&amp;rsquo;t care what gender you are or what colour you are or what your dark secret is - &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the role model to inspire someone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/p/just-do-something.html&#34;&gt;Just do it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;object height=&#34;395&#34; width=&#34;395&#34;&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;wmode&#34; value=&#34;direct&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#222222&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;sv=true&amp;amp;pageId=3513&#34;/&gt;  &lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; flashVars=&#34;sv=true&amp;amp;pageId=3513&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#222222&#34; width=&#34;395&#34; height=&#34;395&#34;/&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Agile&#43;&#43;: When Agile Goes Well</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/agile_when_agile_goes_well/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/agile_when_agile_goes_well/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;If you see anything about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemanifesto.org/&#34;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt;.  However, no-one&amp;rsquo;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know.  Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it.  And I realised eventually that&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agile process followed at LMAX is one that works for the individuals and the organisation there.  And that&amp;rsquo;s because they do one thing very well - they regularly examine the issues faced and adapt the process to try and combat them.  It&amp;rsquo;s an agile process that&amp;rsquo;s, well, very agile - it&amp;rsquo;s constantly changing.  Documenting it would only represent a single snapshot in time that would be out of date almost as soon as the next retrospective comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any process can inspire &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult#Pacific_cults_of_World_War_II&#34;&gt;Cargo Cultism&lt;/a&gt;, and the last thing I want to do is give people a process to without the tools to know whether it&amp;rsquo;s the right thing for them or not.  It&amp;rsquo;s more important to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/what-my-hangovers-can-teach-you-about.html&#34;&gt;understand your goals, check progress and improve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking this through with a colleague, Israel, and he rightly pointed out the tool that LMAX can share with everyone else - thinking.  Examining the problems, visualising them, and trying out different ways to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So at Devoxx &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/IsraKaos&#34;&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and I presented a session on &amp;ldquo;Agile++&amp;rdquo;, using LMAX as a use case of when agile methods work.  The session examines four specific issues encountered at LMAX and the steps taken to solve them, and it&amp;rsquo;s available on Parleys.  Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;object height=&#34;395&#34; width=&#34;395&#34;&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;wmode&#34; value=&#34;direct&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#222222&#34;/&gt;  &lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;sv=true&amp;amp;pageId=3486&#34;/&gt;  &lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; flashVars=&#34;sv=true&amp;amp;pageId=3486&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#222222&#34; width=&#34;395&#34; height=&#34;395&#34;/&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of my very first &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/my-first-official-mongodb-appearance.html&#34;&gt;MongoDB webinar,&lt;/a&gt; I was&amp;hellip; encouraged&amp;hellip; to do another.  Here at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ve been running a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/presentations?application=154&amp;amp;programming_lang=All&amp;amp;speaker=&amp;amp;event=&amp;amp;language=All&#34;&gt;series of webinars&lt;/a&gt; around using MongoDB in the financial services domain.  Yesterday was the last in the series, and was presented in association with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.c24.biz/&#34;&gt;C24&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jtdavies&#34;&gt;John Davies&lt;/a&gt;, their CTO, did most of the talking, and demonstrated their product for automatically turning financial messages from one format into another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzNTQ3MDI5OTY3MDMmcHQ9MTM1NDcwMzAwMTcwMSZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz*1YzY5N2U3NzliYTc*ODk3YWExOGFlZjQx/MGYzODA5NiZvZj*w.gif&#34; style=&#34;height: 0px; visibility: hidden; width: 0px;&#34; width=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;object allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allownetworking=&#34;all&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; data=&#34;http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_jiqyo6hd/uiconf_id/48501&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; id=&#34;kaltura_player_1354702995&#34; name=&#34;kaltura_player_1354702995&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowNetworking&#34; value=&#34;all&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#000000&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_jiqyo6hd/uiconf_id/48501&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com&#34;&gt;video platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_management&#34;&gt;video management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/solutions/video_solution&#34;&gt;video solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_publishing&#34;&gt;video player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Slides and webinar &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/presentations/webinar-processing-high-volume-data-feeds-mongodb-fix-fpml-and-swift-association-c24&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt; - and you&amp;rsquo;re not going deaf, the sound doesn&amp;rsquo;t start until about 3:44 into the video)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a fun webinar to do, actually - I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.c24.biz/io-mongodb.html&#34;&gt;C24&amp;rsquo;s iO&lt;/a&gt; tool, so I learnt quite a lot as I watched John navigate the demo.  My background in trying to debug raw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fixprotocol.org/FIXimate3.0/&#34;&gt;FIX&lt;/a&gt; messages probably skewed my questions, I was definitely more interested in how to use it as a developer and what it could give me if I were doing production support.  It&amp;rsquo;s a dead interesting tool - I know for a fact that many organisations, banks in particular, spend a lot of time translating stuff from one format to another, before making some decision on on what to do with the contents.  This tool does all the heavy lifting so you can get on with the interesting stuff, the stuff your business actually needs you to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, as someone with more of an FS background than a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/nosql-is-stupid-name.html&#34;&gt;NoSQL&lt;/a&gt; background, I was very interested to hear how lots of the financial institutions are using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; already - the combination of not having an enforced schema but supporting structured data, supported by fast execution, makes it a good fit for a lot of the problems they&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve.  Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s my job to say nice things about MongoDB, but when businesses are already using it because it makes their lives easier and meets their needs, it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling that the product must be doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed giving this webinar, I think if I do any more I will suggest pairing on it (we all know two heads are better than one, right?) - it gives you some of the feedback and energy that&amp;rsquo;s hard to get in a darkened room talking to a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>My First Official MongoDB Appearance</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_first_official_mongodb_appearance/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 30 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_first_official_mongodb_appearance/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the &lt;strike&gt;nerve-wracking&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;dubious&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;alarming&lt;/strike&gt; great pleasure of presenting my first official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;-shaped talk.  This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t really.  For a start, you can&amp;rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.  Also, because you&amp;rsquo;re not standing in front of people, I think the &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; around making sure your slides don&amp;rsquo;t distract from you are a little different - it strikes me that webinars are more like a set of slides with a narrator and a fixed time, than a presenter with a set of slides to emphasise points.  This puts the medium in an awkward position between an &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Infodeck.html&#34;&gt;infodeck&lt;/a&gt; and a talk (yes, I am reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321820800/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321820800&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Presentation Patterns&lt;/a&gt; at the moment, and it&amp;rsquo;s making me very conscious of all my slides and presentations).  So my slides are more info-heavy than my usual style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually learnt a lot while I was putting together this webinar, so whether you&amp;rsquo;re completely new to NoSQL/MongoDB, or just starting to use it from a language running on the JVM, it&amp;rsquo;s worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://c.gigcount.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.11NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEzNTQyNzA*MzcxMDEmcHQ9MTM1NDI3MDQ1MTI3MyZwPSZkPSZnPTImbz*1YzY5N2U3NzliYTc*ODk3YWExOGFlZjQx/MGYzODA5NiZvZj*w.gif&#34; style=&#34;height: 0px; visibility: hidden; width: 0px;&#34; width=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;object allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; allownetworking=&#34;all&#34; allowscriptaccess=&#34;always&#34; data=&#34;http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_w86rx78e/uiconf_id/48501&#34; height=&#34;330&#34; id=&#34;kaltura_player_1354270434&#34; name=&#34;kaltura_player_1354270434&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowNetworking&#34; value=&#34;all&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#000000&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.kaltura.com/index.php/kwidget/wid/1_w86rx78e/uiconf_id/48501&#34;/&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com&#34;&gt;video platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_management&#34;&gt;video management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/solutions/video_solution&#34;&gt;video solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://corp.kaltura.com/video_platform/video_publishing&#34;&gt;video player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Or see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://is.gd/2OEqQf&#34;&gt;webinar and slides together&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, feedback very much appreciated - I think there&amp;rsquo;s great material in here, but I already have some ideas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/89353112/&#34;&gt;London Java Community Open Conference&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and  got me excited about the prospects for 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&amp;rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how much I&amp;rsquo;ve been presenting lately, and with the conferences piling on top of each other back-to-back leaving little time for preparation, I had decided not to speak at the open conference, but to sit and learn for a change - it&amp;rsquo;s a great opportunity for new speakers to present for a start.  But that resolution lasted all of 3.54 milliseconds.  After all, if people don&amp;rsquo;t like the sessions I propose, they won&amp;rsquo;t come, so I lose nothing by suggesting some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KsBmTFUz6Q8/ULNWmfp96wI/AAAAAAAALVY/LCj0GtWn5iA/s1600/highres_182314542.jpeg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;285&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KsBmTFUz6Q8/ULNWmfp96wI/AAAAAAAALVY/LCj0GtWn5iA/s320/highres_182314542.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Photo by Ged Byrne&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;First up, it was a very great honour to be giving my very first Keynote.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben Evans&lt;/a&gt; and I presented on the State of Java - a summary of this last year from the point of view of our community and globally, and a view to next year.  I know we&amp;rsquo;ve had an incredible year as the LJC, it was really satisfying to be able to summarise this for everyone there, to present what we&amp;rsquo;ve achieved locally and globally.  And looking forward to the future, there&amp;rsquo;s so much more we can do as individuals trying to improve our skills (especially with Java 8 due), as a London-focussed community (with our own events, our sister communities, and with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Home&#34;&gt;Devoxx UK&lt;/a&gt;), and globally (with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;JCP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I was roped into a Java Performance panel, with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jclarity.com/&#34;&gt;JClarity&lt;/a&gt; guys (Ben, Richard and John).  I was surprised to see that not many in the audience were working on low latency systems - in London you&amp;rsquo;ll frequently find a room full of Java developers who are all working in finance on things that have specific performance requirements.  It was good that we had a this variety of developers, because it meant we covered a much broader range of subjects, and could discuss what to think about and where to get started when you&amp;rsquo;re considering your non-functional requirements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after that I was on &lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt; panel, with some of the same suspects, talking about the LJC&amp;rsquo;s involvement in the Java Community Process and the Open JDK.  I really like these sessions because it&amp;rsquo;s easy for us, who are dealing with these things at least on a weekly basis, to forget that most of our members aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with either of these two things.  What&amp;rsquo;s encouraging though is that after just a short introduction to what they are and how we can impact them, most people want to be involved in some way.  The hack days are particularly appealing to developers (not surprising).  Although we&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of very successful hack days, we still need to work out a way to scale them - how do we attract more people?  How do we make the best use of their time?  In particular, we need to work out how to cater for people with different timetables (weekends vs evenings vs week days), and how to handle the split between beginners and those who have already been to at least one hack day.  I&amp;rsquo;m excited about what we&amp;rsquo;ve achieved so far with the hack days, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s so much more that can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I3N9vqPNKi4/ULNhpWcXKkI/AAAAAAAALVs/h3s24OgDDzY/s1600/2012-11-24+15.22.04.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I3N9vqPNKi4/ULNhpWcXKkI/AAAAAAAALVs/h3s24OgDDzY/s320/2012-11-24+15.22.04.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t tell from this photo, but there were girls this year&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Over lunch there was a series of lightning talks.  I really like the way the lightning talks are presented to everyone in the conference.  I like the variety of topics, and I like that it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy for a new speaker to give a 5 minute talk, with as little or as much preparation as they want.  The one I remember most was on software for elections from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flor3scu&#34;&gt;Alex Florescu&lt;/a&gt; - I thought that looked like an interesting (and difficult!) business domain, which needs novel solutions in order to get acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up, I gave an intro to NoSQL  From &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/devoxx-2012_22.html&#34;&gt;Devoxx&lt;/a&gt;, it was clear that while a lot of developers have heard of the NoSQL movement, and of databases like MongoDB, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear to them why you&amp;rsquo;d chose these over traditional databases. Which is a relief to me, because that&amp;rsquo;s exactly where I was three months ago.  So this was a really quick (30 minute) overview of the different flavours of NoSQL, what they&amp;rsquo;re good for and why you might pick one over another.  Obviously there was a focus on MongoDB, since this is the one I know most about, but I also covered the strengths of some of the others.  I really enjoyed giving this session - the audience was perfect for the topic, the questions were intelligent and drove the direction of the discussion, and I had a number of positive comments from people who felt like they had learnt something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave another session which was a recap of the JavaOne and Devoxx &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-problem-with-women-technical.html&#34;&gt;Problem with Women&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; talk, but even shorter.  The fantastic thing about this was the energy from the people in the room - these guys like what they do and they&amp;rsquo;re keen to tell other people how great it is to work as a developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TlnmMCGMwU8/ULNwvqNx6fI/AAAAAAAALWE/2R3nLfmcLzg/s1600/2012-11-24+13.06.00.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TlnmMCGMwU8/ULNwvqNx6fI/AAAAAAAALWE/2R3nLfmcLzg/s320/2012-11-24+13.06.00.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Finally, I managed to actually attend a couple of talks too.  Barry led &amp;ldquo;Why is technical recruitment so broken?&amp;rdquo;, and we had some interesting discussions around the problems employers and developers face, in trying to get the right people into the right roles.  Clearly there is no easy solution, and there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a role for recruitment agents of all kinds in this space, but it would be awesome if we stop floundering around in the dark and actually be able to match the right people to the right jobs more easily.  In seems to me that there is a huge educational piece here: developers can find resources around &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/how-to-make-your-cv-not-suck.html&#34;&gt;how to write their CVs&lt;/a&gt;, how to stand out from the crowd, how to network to increase their chances of finding a good job, but they need to know to start looking for these resources.  Worse, though, is the problem of the employers - if you&amp;rsquo;re a big company you have a non-technical HR department standing between the team needing a developer and the candidates themselves, and smaller companies don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to invest in the hiring process, or going out and networking to meet people at things like LJC events.  It&amp;rsquo;s a tough problem, and one I&amp;rsquo;m extremely interested in.  I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=766&#34;&gt;Attracting Great People&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; track I&amp;rsquo;m running at QCon London will look at some of these issues, and give some advice from those who are doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last session was an exploration of all that is wrong with Agile, led by Ged Byrne.  It was an interesting discussion, the only disappointing thing about it was that everyone agreed with each other!  Certifications Are Meaningless; external Agile coaches and consultants aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily invested in improving your business; a formal Agile process is really defeating the point; and, most importantly, let&amp;rsquo;s try to remember the original &lt;a href=&#34;http://agilemanifesto.org/&#34;&gt;agile manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it was a really great day!  I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/london-java-community-open-conference.html&#34;&gt;last year&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, for many of the same reasons - we have a fantastic community, it&amp;rsquo;s a great event for meeting people, it&amp;rsquo;s brilliant for encouraging new speakers, and if you are speaking you get much better feedback than you do at the large events, because you can involve your audience directly and give them what they really want.  I can&amp;rsquo;t believe how much I personally have achieved since my first solo talk at the LJC Open Conference last year, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what the next year holds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewblack/sets/72157632093043391/&#34;&gt;More photos&lt;/a&gt; from Andrew Black)&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;ve heard people talk about the conference season in the past, and been slightly (OK, very) jealous of all that jet-setting. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll admit, however, to a slight feeling of relief that my focus until Christmas is pretty much going to be coding. &amp;nbsp;I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tRGVrwupluI/UK4SNGpa6vI/AAAAAAAALTY/fKASg2z7mqE/s1600/NealFord.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tRGVrwupluI/UK4SNGpa6vI/AAAAAAAALTY/fKASg2z7mqE/s320/NealFord.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Neal Ford&#39;s When Geek Leaks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;So, how was Devoxx? &amp;nbsp;Well for starters, the calibre of the speakers and talks was excellent. &amp;nbsp;I learnt things in every one I went to - either something I could put into practice at work, or something I could do to improve my own presentations. &amp;nbsp;My favourite was Neal Ford&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/When+Geek+Leaks&#34;&gt;When Geek Leaks&lt;/a&gt; - Neal is a great speaker, and this talk was entertaining and informative. I&#39;m also currently reading his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093J9K14/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0093J9K14&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;Presentation Patterns&lt;/a&gt; book, which is extremely useful. &amp;nbsp;Although obviously I give a bunch of presentations and have found some very handy tips in here, it&#39;s dead handy for everyone, even if you&#39;re just presenting to your boss or team at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Kw7t50i85x0/UK5TTwOWQ7I/AAAAAAAALU8/W1rA0ulMtnA/s1600/IMG_6383.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Kw7t50i85x0/UK5TTwOWQ7I/AAAAAAAALU8/W1rA0ulMtnA/s320/IMG_6383.JPG&#34; width=&#34;305&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The great thing about Devoxx is being able to meet all the European-based people in the Java space. People fight to get to JavaOne, but Devoxx is a lot easier if you&#39;re based over this side of the pond. It&#39;s also easy to run into people in either the exhibition area (where lunch is served, so everyone ends up there at some point), or the central corridor between the rooms (which everyone has to go through at some point). &amp;nbsp;It was really awesome to have so many people grab me either at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; booth or when I was sat at the desks in the corridor. &amp;nbsp;I really like that venue for a conference, the only downside is the seats are so comfortable, people fall asleep in the talks. &amp;nbsp;Even in our presentation (how rude).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of personal highlights from Devoxx now I&#39;m finally free to think about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qnZ2LiLA3Q/UK4eKBMm8gI/AAAAAAAALTs/ppE_fURIttM/s1600/Keynote.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;212&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qnZ2LiLA3Q/UK4eKBMm8gI/AAAAAAAALTs/ppE_fURIttM/s320/Keynote.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was fun making a couple of guest appearances in the keynote, firstly as one of Stephen Chin&#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/nighthacking/&#34;&gt;Nighthacking&lt;/a&gt; crew and then to celebrate the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; being re-elected to the Java Community Process Executive Committee (with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/whatsnew/elections&#34;&gt;massive 33% of the vote&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another re-run of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-problem-with-women-technical.html&#34;&gt;The Problem With Women&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If anything, this went even better than when I ran it at JavaOne. What I really loved about the session is the sheer number of men who turned up. &amp;nbsp;it&#39;s tempting to assume they&#39;re there to heckle, but in fact their active&amp;nbsp;participation&amp;nbsp;in the subject proves to me that the men in this industry are very much on board with trying to address the gender balance. &amp;nbsp;As always, I have so much more to say on this subject, so I&#39;ll make a note to write a separate blog post. &amp;nbsp;In summary, although there are differences in the contributions from the audience in these sessions, there are common themes and a willingness to get involved and Do Something.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6wqO__6WfF0/UK4_h5TkS3I/AAAAAAAALUE/B2eM4iLNPm8/s1600/Agile++.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;253&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6wqO__6WfF0/UK4_h5TkS3I/AAAAAAAALUE/B2eM4iLNPm8/s320/Agile++.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 13px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Agile++ with Israel Boza Rodriguez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exclusive premier of the new Agile++ talk, co-presented with a colleague of mine from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The aim of this presentation was to talk about where you go when your organisation starts with a great agile grounding - what problems might you face and how do you tackle them. &amp;nbsp;Bit confusing for me giving this talk since I was still in LMAX-mode, and I&#39;m very grateful to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for not only allowing me to present this, but actually promoting it for us as well. I&#39;d love to do this session again, I&#39;d like to work out how to without having a split personality as an LMAX person and a MongoDB person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not everything can go swimmingly, so I should probably make an apology for giving the Shortest Talk Ever on Wednesday. &amp;nbsp;It was supposed to be a 20 minute talk about the benefits of open sourcing your software, but it ended up being more like a lightning talk. &amp;nbsp;Lessons learned: 1) no matter how much you think you have to say about a subject, having the speaker notes is still very important (to me) and 2) a bit more preparation, updating the talk given my new role, would have been extremely beneficial - as it was, I cut a lot of the content on the fly and had nothing to replace it with. &amp;nbsp;Oh well, you live and learn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also had a new experience on Tuesday, being on the MongoDB booth in the exhibition space. &amp;nbsp;This was really educational too:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CnQ0T_R5V_k/UK4_ogZX7JI/AAAAAAAALUM/5OeVyDv5yws/s1600/TrishaBoothBabe.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;241&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CnQ0T_R5V_k/UK4_ogZX7JI/AAAAAAAALUM/5OeVyDv5yws/s320/TrishaBoothBabe.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m glad I had a week of intensive MongoDB training the week before, I could actually answer all the technical questions thrown at me - yay me! &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s true that educating people is a really good way to learn stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People are really interested in MongoDB. Many are using it already, but even more are wanting to learn about NoSQL in general, and Mongo specifically. &amp;nbsp;It was really awesome that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Stephan+Janssen&#34;&gt;Stephan&lt;/a&gt; gave a massive boost to Mongo&#39;s reputation, describing how the central data store for the conference technology was MongoDB running on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry&amp;nbsp;Pi&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;You don&#39;t get cooler than that. &amp;nbsp;Numerous&amp;nbsp;other speakers gave very positive stories of using MongoDB too, so we had a lot of people stop by the stand to ask us what it was all about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I was nervous of being on the stand after &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insightofanintern.com/2012/10/02/insight-of-an-intern-sexism-in-tech/&#34;&gt;Ceri&#39;s experiences&lt;/a&gt;, I didn&#39;t notice anyone doubting my ability as a technical person despite being of the female&amp;nbsp;persuasion&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I only had one conversation where the (male) developer I was speaking to kept addressing his questions to the (non-technical) (male) sales person instead of me. &amp;nbsp;But that&#39;s fine, I just kept answering the questions, and maybe I&#39;ve made a slight dent on his (clearly&amp;nbsp;subconscious) assumption that women aren&#39;t techies. &amp;nbsp;I still think the best way to address problems like this is to keep persevering, keep being visible, and to not let your assumptions about what other people are thinking override your own confidence in your abilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;And finally...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KGWIzLonLqU/UK5CX5bYQyI/AAAAAAAALUo/-c-Sn-8ToNM/s1600/DevoxxRobots.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;141&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KGWIzLonLqU/UK5CX5bYQyI/AAAAAAAALUo/-c-Sn-8ToNM/s320/DevoxxRobots.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robots seem to be cool again, and I, for one, welcome our new automated masters. &amp;nbsp;I was totally blown away by the&amp;nbsp;choreographed&amp;nbsp;dancing robotos on stage as a lead up to the keynote. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think the only way to top that for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Home&#34;&gt;Devoxx UK&lt;/a&gt; is Robot Dancing&amp;nbsp;Tyrannosaurus&amp;nbsp;Rexes. &amp;nbsp;On caffeine. &amp;nbsp;Destroying Lego cities.&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The moral of today&amp;rsquo;s story - be careful what you wish for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PVrZ4O0uZiI/UKtda1uCk8I/AAAAAAAALSk/zAEZTTsZ-CM/s1600/my-brain.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PVrZ4O0uZiI/UKtda1uCk8I/AAAAAAAALSk/zAEZTTsZ-CM/s1600/my-brain.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my brain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fhy7-UY1ZcY/UKtdkkumAZI/AAAAAAAALSs/eU0rlnuLmDE/s1600/normal.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fhy7-UY1ZcY/UKtdkkumAZI/AAAAAAAALSs/eU0rlnuLmDE/s1600/normal.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the normal course of my life, it&amp;rsquo;s filled with Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UJykTQjVnOY/UKteXwj47PI/AAAAAAAALS0/08oNJ40PdVg/s1600/mongodb.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UJykTQjVnOY/UKteXwj47PI/AAAAAAAALS0/08oNJ40PdVg/s1600/mongodb.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UJykTQjVnOY/UKteXwj47PI/AAAAAAAALS0/08oNJ40PdVg/s1600/mongodb.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early in November, 10gen ordered me to go to New York to learn about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; (Oh No!  My Life Is So Hard!).  I was looking forward to shopping and taking photos of the devastation wrought by Sandy, but actually I spent the whole time drinking from the firehose of MongoDB information provided by my ridiculously smart, ridiculously well-informed colleagues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I didn&amp;rsquo;t even buy shoes!  But I did buy a new winter coat, so there is some balance in the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rDm80VyCwmg/UKtfMnkQ-0I/AAAAAAAALS8/lyXF4E91TMY/s1600/devoxx.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rDm80VyCwmg/UKtfMnkQ-0I/AAAAAAAALS8/lyXF4E91TMY/s1600/devoxx.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rDm80VyCwmg/UKtfMnkQ-0I/AAAAAAAALS8/lyXF4E91TMY/s1600/devoxx.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24 hours after landing back in in London, I was on a train on my way to Antwerp for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home&#34;&gt;Devoxx&lt;/a&gt;.  There, I did three talks, including a new talk on Agile, co-presented with a colleague from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; (a teeny snippet of which can be seen in the video on the Devoxx home page).  Running from thing to thing, helping out at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; stand and meeting new people and those I count as friends kept me pretty busy (did I mention My Life Is So Hard?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eG_pYdMY4gc/UKtfcTBR7FI/AAAAAAAALTE/W8doP8E2nW4/s1600/full-brain.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eG_pYdMY4gc/UKtfcTBR7FI/AAAAAAAALTE/W8doP8E2nW4/s1600/full-brain.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;and now I&amp;rsquo;m at Skillsmatter &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/scala-exchange-2012&#34;&gt;Scala Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, writing a blog post instead of listening to the talks. Because I&amp;rsquo;ve got no more space in my brain for anything, let alone a new language I haven&amp;rsquo;t studied at all (don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I&amp;rsquo;m not travelling again for the rest of the year, so I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to start doing some Actual Code some time soon.  I have one last conference, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/89353112/&#34;&gt;LJC Open Conference&lt;/a&gt; this Saturday, which fortunately is on home ground.  If I can get away with it, I&amp;rsquo;ll go and watch other people talk rather than perform myself.  For any LJC guys reading, you can submit talks in advance, or suggest &lt;a href=&#34;http://conf.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;topics you want to see&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This blog post was brought to you by a person who had an iPad, a stylus, and a desire to procrastinate against doing important stuff like reporting her stolen bike to the insurance company)&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s Java Magazine features an article by me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben Evans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn Verburg&lt;/a&gt; about the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/&#34;&gt;lambdas&lt;/a&gt; coming in &lt;a href=&#34;http://jdk8.java.net/&#34;&gt;Java 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aim of the article is to give an overview to normal, human Java developers, who don&amp;rsquo;t need to know the theory behind what they are or how they work under the covers, but want to know how to use them when they get the shiny new version of Java next year (or even get ahead of the curve and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/&#34;&gt;try them now&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34;&gt;            &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: #d2d2d2; height: 30px;&#34;&gt;                &lt;td&gt;&lt;img align=&#34;left&#34; alt=&#34;www.oracle.com/javamagazine&#34; class=&#34;navlogo&#34; height=&#34;28&#34; src=&#34;http://images-cdn.dashdigital.com/javamagazine/include/icons/navbar_logo.gif?lm=1352311955000&#34; /&gt;                &lt;/td&gt;                &lt;td align=&#34;right&#34; style=&#34;color: #666666; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 15px; padding-right: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;top_right_text&#34;&gt;Look inside &amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;/td&gt;             &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;                &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;padding: 10px 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20121112?pg=35&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&#39;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20121112?pg=35&#39;,&#39;sharewidget&#39;,&#39;toolbar=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,left=0,top=0,width=&#39;+(screen.width-10)+&#39;,height=&#39;+(screen.height-10)+&#39;&#39;);return false;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;View Magazine&#34;&gt;                  &lt;img alt=&#34;34&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://images-cdn.dashdigital.com/javamagazine/20121112/data/imgpages/smtn/0035_egfgcb.gif?lm=1352311955000&#34; /&gt;                &lt;/a&gt;                &lt;/td&gt;            &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr style=&#34;background-color: #d2d2d2; height: 30px;&#34;&gt;                &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;color: #666666; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 15px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;bottom_text&#34;&gt;Exploring Lambda Expressions for the Java Language and the JVM&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;/td&gt;            &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;On the same day &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/interview-and-hacking-session-with.html&#34;&gt;Stephen Chin came to see me&lt;/a&gt; at the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community.  Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaFX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/f2a9XvZNq0o&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On Monday, &lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/&#34;&gt;Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; from Oracle visited me at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; offices as part of his &lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/nighthacking/&#34;&gt;NightHacking tour&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In the video we talk about my sessions at JavaOne and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6391499&#34;&gt;Agile presentation&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m giving at Devoxx, and I do some very basic hacking using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Tutorial&#34;&gt;MongoDB Java driver&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to showcase &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gradle.org/&#34;&gt;gradle&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. It was a fun experience, even if it&#39;s scary being live-streamed and recorded!

            <title>NoSQL is a Stupid Name</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/nosql_is_a_stupid_name/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/nosql_is_a_stupid_name/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished my first full week in the new job and I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt lots of new stuff.  Which is great, because that&amp;rsquo;s usually why you change jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot about these new-fangled &lt;a href=&#34;http://nosql-database.org/&#34;&gt;NoSQL&lt;/a&gt; database thingies.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html&#34;&gt;LMAX architecture&lt;/a&gt; was based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path.  Therefore doing anything radical to the storage side of the architecture was just not high on the list of priorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything I knew about NoSQL I learnt from the various conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to in the last year, and even then that&amp;rsquo;s limited - without a business reason to pursue knowledge I know it&amp;rsquo;ll just leak out of my brain, so I avoid sessions with no immediate applicability to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s summarise what I knew about NoSQL databases before last week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t use SQL.  Who knew? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are different flavours.  There&amp;rsquo;s a graphy one and key-value things and&amp;hellip; others&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;scalable&amp;rdquo; (yes, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb-is-web-scale.com/&#34;&gt;web scale&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some/many/all(?) embrace the idea of eventual consistency &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was suspicious of the hype surrounding NoSQL, partly because it&amp;rsquo;s associated with the meaningless marketing term &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; and partly because I&amp;rsquo;m a cynic that sneers at things that get too popular.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think when I hear the following terms:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloud&lt;/i&gt; - Fire your systems people and ditch your comms room!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Big Data&lt;/i&gt; - Parse Twitter in order to learn how to read your customer&amp;rsquo;s minds!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;NoSQL&lt;/i&gt; - Stop paying Oracle!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Functional&lt;/i&gt; - We couldn&amp;rsquo;t get good enough at mainstream programming languages so we switched to something more difficult!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s healthy to be this cynical, but I&amp;rsquo;m too old to jump on every bandwagon that comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway&lt;/i&gt;. Back to the people who now pay my bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that the lack of SQL is the thing that captured the imagination, rather than the lack of tables and a relational structure.  SQL was never (in my mind) a particularly evil thing, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good language for saying &amp;ldquo;I want this stuff from this place that fits these criteria&amp;rdquo;, and that&amp;rsquo;s something we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to do at some point whatever the technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rather more important that it&amp;rsquo;s the structure of the data that&amp;rsquo;s different in NoSQL databases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a traditional relational databases you have tables, and relationships between those tables are achieved with foreign keys.  I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think of these as something kind of grid-shaped with links between them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6nq0Sj37TrM/UIZ3pM-gV0I/AAAAAAAALPQ/1UDd1SgnHt8/s1600/Relational.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6nq0Sj37TrM/UIZ3pM-gV0I/AAAAAAAALPQ/1UDd1SgnHt8/s320/Relational.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Series of database tables and their relationships.  Honest.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;(Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting again. This time with my shiny new iPad, a stylus and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8&#34;&gt;Penultimate&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s good for ad-hoc drawings, but lacks the precision of the graphics tablet and flexibility of GIMP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;At the very high level, it seems like there are four (ish) types of NoSQL databases: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Column Family &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key/Value &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graph &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Document &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;b&gt;Column Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Column family databases feel to me, as a newbie to the field, similar to key/value, which I&amp;rsquo;ll come on to. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly heard &lt;a href=&#34;http://cassandra.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt; used as an example of this type of NoSQL database. I guess the way I think of this, and of course I could be wrong/over-simplifying, is a unique key linked to a set of key/values:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/3938260.js?file=gistfile1.txt&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which I&amp;rsquo;m translating into groups of key/value pairs, with a the ID as a sort of header: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xexa2Oo1KjI/UIZ4miTPudI/AAAAAAAALPY/ZCxFVbTpsRk/s1600/ColumnFamily2.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;145&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xexa2Oo1KjI/UIZ4miTPudI/AAAAAAAALPY/ZCxFVbTpsRk/s320/ColumnFamily2.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Key/value pairs grouped by ID&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;You need the key in order to look up all the details about me.  The way I hear it, it&amp;rsquo;s great for writing data, but it&amp;rsquo;s less flexible for ad-hoc queries.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key/Value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These types of NoSQL database (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/&#34;&gt;Riak&lt;/a&gt;) are pretty much as schema-less as you get - just dump key-value pairs into them.  To be honest, the best description I found was on &lt;a href=&#34;http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/607/what-is-a-key-value-store-database&#34;&gt;dba.stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt;, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to re-write that with my (at this point) limited understanding.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puUC12LdQkg/UIZ48Oiw4FI/AAAAAAAALPg/mrMKn8PWCw8/s1600/KeyValue.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puUC12LdQkg/UIZ48Oiw4FI/AAAAAAAALPg/mrMKn8PWCw8/s200/KeyValue.png&#34; width=&#34;125&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Never ending lists of key/values&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;From what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard so far, both Key/Value and Column Family databases embrace &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency&#34;&gt;eventual consistency&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of that is a function of their data model and how much is decided by the individual products.  For some people eventual consistency is deal-breaker, but in many cases it seems to me that it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of getting your head around this and designing your application appropriately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graph&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across graph databases when I stumbled across &lt;a href=&#34;http://neo4j.org/&#34;&gt;Neo4j&lt;/a&gt;, chatting to some of the very smart guys there.  A graph database lets you model you data as a series of nodes and relationships.  And if I think about it, this is not a massive step from either relational models &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; object models.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t just apply well to the social networking domain (where it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to think in terms of users and their relationships), in actual fact lots of things we design could be modelled this way.  Not having used it, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure just how much of a mental leap you need to take to start thinking that way, but it seems like it might be a good fit for many problems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RTpXIRNJm5M/UIZ5IS5n3ZI/AAAAAAAALPo/cer-1dsRSXs/s1600/Graph.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;188&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RTpXIRNJm5M/UIZ5IS5n3ZI/AAAAAAAALPo/cer-1dsRSXs/s200/Graph.png&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Graph of nodes with annotated relationships&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in what the architectural trade-offs in using this model are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Document&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;Now MongoDB falls into category four, the document database.  And as a NoSQL &lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;n00b&lt;/span&gt;, this is now the product and area I know most about, and am clearly going to be more excited about since &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; are indoctrinating me in the MongoDB way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-weight: normal;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Documents are a familiar structure for developers, especially if they&amp;rsquo;ve been working with JSON.  So, a document might be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/3938248.js?file=gistfile1.txt&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To me, this looks like it maps onto to my domain-shaped Object Model more easily than a relational database, which always needs some sort of O-R mapping (whether you do this with hibernate or use Spring to do it yourself, you&amp;rsquo;re still mapping tables into objects and vice versa).  What I like about the document format is the nested sub-documents for data that belongs together.  In relational databases you often end up denormalising for performance anyway, so why not just accept that up front and have it as part of the thing you&amp;rsquo;re storing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1bL7VJuNNg4/UIaA2mq8jZI/AAAAAAAALQA/KWM3_1Mzr7A/s1600/Document1.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1bL7VJuNNg4/UIaA2mq8jZI/AAAAAAAALQA/KWM3_1Mzr7A/s200/Document1.png&#34; width=&#34;163&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;A document with sub-documents.    Think XML/JSON.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This does have a cost, of course - nothing is without trade-offs.  Every time you request this document, you get the whole lot.  You can&amp;rsquo;t have the person without the address.  So, you do need to understand the relationships (still) and whether you&amp;rsquo;re usually going to want to get all that data at the same time or whether you might want to make two separate calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me on to another thing which is familiar from relational days - foreign keys.  A field in your document can be the ID of another document, so you can follow the links through and retrieve other documents associated with the starting one.  Again, there are trade-offs here - each link you follow is a different request to the database.  These database requests can be very quick, but if you wanted this data every time, you&amp;rsquo;d probably want it embeded in your first document to save the additional call.  I guess it&amp;rsquo;s a latency vs throughput question really - a single query which returns a chunky document, or multiple queries that return smaller ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VhPGWfgeWt0/UIaJ4gXvdgI/AAAAAAAALQg/kSnNli89oIw/s1600/Document2.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;194&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VhPGWfgeWt0/UIaJ4gXvdgI/AAAAAAAALQg/kSnNli89oIw/s320/Document2.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Documents can link to other documents.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;So schema design is still important in document databases even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a relational schema.  No new technology is an excuse to stop thinking about the problem you&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve and understanding the tradeoffs in design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the advantages, it seems, of something like MongoDB over some of the key/value databases is the ability to write ad-hoc queries and to tune for those queries.  The data is structured (it&amp;rsquo;s in a document) and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be in the same structure every time - not every document relating to a person needs all the fields that another person might have.  But you can still query for people who have blue cars or people who live in London, or people who&amp;rsquo;s surnames begin with G.  If you find yourself doing the same query a number of times, you can add indexes to MongoDB the same way you would a relational database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semms like I&amp;rsquo;m getting into more of the nitty-gritty MongoDB details, so I&amp;rsquo;ll stop there and leave that for another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classing a whole swathe of products as &amp;ldquo;NoSQL&amp;rdquo; is misleading and confusing.  The only thing they all share in common is that they are not traditional relational databases.  Other than that, some of them are as different from each other as they are from relational databases.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t even mentioned caching technologies - these products have functionality which overlaps with NoSQL databases as well.  But even then, the purposes are somewhat different, and not even mutually exclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with anything, it&amp;rsquo;s really important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a technology, and the demands of your domain.  These different ways of organising data, and different products, are going to perform really well in certain circumstances, and pretty poorly when used in others.  Getting an understanding of what those strengths and weaknesses are is going to be important in making the correct product/architecture/design decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this information is new, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of material on the web about the different types of NoSQL databases. I&amp;rsquo;m writing it more for my own benefit than anything else, my memory is notoriously shocking.  For more in-depth (and probably more accurate reading) there&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090J3SYW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0090J3SYW&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&#34;&gt;NoSQL Distilled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B0090J3SYW&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and his &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/nosql-intro.pdf&#34;&gt;introduction to the subject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tim Berglund (@tlberglund) did a great overview of three types at JAX London last week.  There&amp;rsquo;s a video of the same content (different conference) &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/51660128&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nosql-database.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nosql-database.org/&#34;&gt;http://nosql-database.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appears to list all the products that fall under the massive umbrella, but isn&amp;rsquo;t the most usable of sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And yes, I used Wikipedia.  Which is probably where I went wrong&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Seemed like a quiet conference this year.  Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people.  Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A great keynote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://kirk.blog-city.com/&#34;&gt;Kirk Pepperdine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn Verburg&lt;/a&gt;, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&amp;rsquo;s interest, but it&amp;rsquo;s more likely to be a one-off)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by &lt;a href=&#34;http://bad-concurrency.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Mike Barker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was great to see a number of LJC regulars presenting, especially as my own schedule has been so crazy I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many of them for a long time.  So I missed sessions from &lt;a href=&#34;http://JAxlondon.com/2012/speaker/&#34;&gt;Bruce, John, Sandro, Russell, James &amp;amp; Richard&lt;/a&gt;, but I heard good things about the sessions and was really pleased to chat to all of them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The highlight of the conference for me though was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.briangoetz.com/&#34;&gt;Brian Goetz&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s keynote and subsequent session on &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/lambda/&#34;&gt;lambdas&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into lambdas because I think it&amp;rsquo;s a really interesting addition to the language and I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot of noise about them.  What I thought was most interesting about Brian&amp;rsquo;s talks though was less the information on what they were and how to use them, and more the challenges that face language designers when they have a language which is used by 10 million developers and has been going for nearly 20 years.  Ouch.  It&amp;rsquo;s amazing they get anything done, let alone something like lambdas which the language was never designed to support.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In keeping with the new job, I went to a few sessions on the Big Data Con - frankly an unfortunate name I feel.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rit&#34;&gt;Brendan&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Mongo &amp;amp; JVM talk was useful, especially given that I might actually be presenting that at some point.  What I&amp;rsquo;d love to see though is a more interesting story around the Java driver.  It seems people believe the Java driver needs a little love.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other interesting NoSql talk was from &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/tlberglund&#34;&gt;Tim Berglund&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s NoSql Smackdown, which was a really great way of highlighting that the NoSql databases are not all solving the same types of problems.  The room was packed and the questions were intelligent, so it seems there&amp;rsquo;s still a lot of interest in this kind of introduction to the technology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lessons learned:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commuting through Victoria Station sucks.  I knew this last year but it&amp;rsquo;s just got worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The iPad + stylus combo is not as precise as the graphics tablet, so I&amp;rsquo;m probably going back to that for illustrations.  But I&amp;rsquo;d still love to do free-drawing with the iPad on the projector at some point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone can follow the deep-dive tech talks, but they still prefer them to introductory talks, maybe because they feel like they&amp;rsquo;re learning something (well, that&amp;rsquo;s my opinion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I took practically no photos because I kept forgetting I had my camera.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s the weird subterranean effect of the hotel basement.  Either that or I&amp;rsquo;ve turned into a conference zombie - not an unlikely suggestion.  And I&amp;rsquo;ve still got Devoxx round the corner&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>And for my next trick....</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/and_for_my_next_trick/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The time has come, and I&amp;rsquo;m moving on from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve had an incredible (nearly) four years working
for one of the most radical finance firms in the world, during which time I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt more than the rest of my work experience
put together, and had the pleasure to work with some of the smartest and most interesting people I&amp;rsquo;ve ever met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been invited to join &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.10gen.com/&#34;&gt;10gen&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt; driver team,
a challenge I am really looking forward to. After years in finance and in the IT departments of other organisations,
I&amp;rsquo;m finally working for a product firm, and an open source one. I expect it will be very different from anything else I&amp;rsquo;ve been
involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; this means I will be blogging even more, and that I&amp;rsquo;ll have opportunities to abuse my graphics tablet producing more
ridiculous scrawlings. I also hope this will give me an opportunity to meet more people as I travel around. So,
as if this were a goodbye e-mail to the company or an out-of-office reply, I should finish with: any further enquiries about the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; should be addressed to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/lmax-disruptor&#34;&gt;Google Groups list&lt;/a&gt; - there are people on there waaay
smarter than me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve produced a very cut down version of the presentation I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving at a lot of conferences, giving a high level overview to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.  This serves as a quick intro to the concepts behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14664796&#34; style=&#34;border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;&#34; width=&#34;427&#34;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;align: center; margin-bottom: 5px;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/introduction-to-the-disruptor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Introduction to the Disruptor&#34;&gt;Introduction to the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trisha Gee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&amp;rsquo;t forget there&amp;rsquo;s always my original blog posts (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html&#34;&gt;Magic Ring Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-how-do-i-read-from.html&#34;&gt;Reading from it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html&#34;&gt;Writing to it&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html&#34;&gt;Wiring it up&lt;/a&gt;), which are now pretty dated, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/java-magazine-intro-to-disruptor-part.html&#34;&gt;Java Magazine&lt;/a&gt; article I wrote at the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4LX8X74MR1M/UG9HT1hdisI/AAAAAAAALMs/TWP67rS4B8Q/s1600/TaylorStCafe.png&#34;

cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x24hP1hzAyU/UG9Ho-cDcsI/AAAAAAAALNE/7QqjOp7FTqQ/s1600/gosling.png&#34;

on stage!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having well-known Java people say Hi to me out of the blue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-problem-with-women-technical.html&#34;&gt;Women in Technology session&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I already mentioned the technical keynote in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-user-group-sunday.html&#34;&gt;summary of Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, but I forgot to talk about Dr Robert Ballard&#39;s section, which is crazy because it was so inspiring. &amp;nbsp;What I got out of that was how much fun technology can be, and how kids are really ready to be amazed and engaged with science and technology, provided you get them young enough. &amp;nbsp;I also really loved that the photos of all the scientists showed great diversity, something he seems to take very seriously. &amp;nbsp;His comment was &#34;A child needs to see their face 20 years out to know they can play in the game. Don&#39;t sell science, sell scientists and engineers&#34;. &amp;nbsp;The point I took from that was that by focussing on &#34;science&#34; and &#34;technology&#34;, we could be losing people - by showcasing the people, the talent, the passions, we are much more likely to engage children. &amp;nbsp;And I think that stands for adults as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XzDZJM8QFHA/UG9H6aw8GGI/AAAAAAAALNY/A8iBGCFDGWQ/s1600/robots-and-people.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XzDZJM8QFHA/UG9H6aw8GGI/AAAAAAAALNY/A8iBGCFDGWQ/s320/robots-and-people.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 13px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;A robot!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;And this nicely fits the message I was trying to get across in my session on Wednesday (which I know I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/javaone-problem-with-women-technical.html&#34;&gt;already blogged about&lt;/a&gt;) - it&#39;s dead important to address the failure points when it comes to diversity, but I think we forget to push the positives - the reason we don&#39;t understand why some groups of people are under-represented in technology is because we all love being here, it&#39;s a great industry to work in. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d love to see our passions more widely showcased than simply at conferences where we&#39;re a self-selecting audience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bfal0DsvHx4/UG9HIvDYvLI/AAAAAAAALMY/ehlSr0SOVko/s1600/LJC.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bfal0DsvHx4/UG9HIvDYvLI/AAAAAAAALMY/ehlSr0SOVko/s400/LJC.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The LJC panel about our involvement in the Java Community Process&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not only was this a great JavaOne for me personally, it was a real triumph for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Last year there were only two of us here, and Martijn was working hard to introduce me to the other JUG leaders and the people on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;JCP&lt;/a&gt; committee that we were going to be working with over the next 12 months. &amp;nbsp;This year, there were five of us here, spreading the word about our work as a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/participation/committee&#34;&gt;Executive Committee&lt;/a&gt; of the Java Community Process (the Java standards body), primarily our &lt;a href=&#34;http://adoptajsr.org/&#34;&gt;Adopt a JSR&lt;/a&gt; program. &amp;nbsp;We also wanted to talk to a load of people about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/projects/adoptopenjdk/pages/AdoptOpenJDK&#34;&gt;Adopt OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; program as well, we&#39;ve found lots of developers are really keen to develop the language itself, Java at the fundamental level, and we really want to help bridge the gap between the guys who work on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openjdk.java.net/&#34;&gt;OpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; project and the developers in the community. &amp;nbsp;But all our hard work over the last year, kicking off these programs and working with other user groups and Oracle to really harness the power of the community, has been recognised. &amp;nbsp;We&#39;ve won not one, but two awards - woohoo! &amp;nbsp;Fame, glory, girls/boys, money etc await us! &amp;nbsp;Well, not quite... but it&#39;s certainly nice to be the &#34;Award Winning London Java Community&#34;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ob5Soi91ze0/UG9G_0Nnm4I/AAAAAAAALMQ/sCzbt6FMGiY/s1600/community-keynote.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ob5Soi91ze0/UG9G_0Nnm4I/AAAAAAAALMQ/sCzbt6FMGiY/s320/community-keynote.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The LJC in the Community Keynote&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our two shiny accolades are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1854931&#34;&gt;Duke&#39;s Choice Award&lt;/a&gt; for Innovation and Contributions to the Community&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/jcp/entry/10th_annual_jcp_award_winners&#34;&gt;JCP Member of the Year&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://soujava.org.br/&#34;&gt;SouJava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, a really great JavaOne. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m not sure, if I&#39;m honest, who reads my summaries of conferences - I know lots of people do read them, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s those who went to the conference or those who would have liked to have gone, or those who don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like at conferences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But in case this is useful to anyone who is reading this, next year come to JavaOne if:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to know what&#39;s coming up for Java the platform or Java the language&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to meet, or at least see presenting, the people who are actually making these changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to meet other Java developers from around the world - whether you want to find someone with the same problems as you, or want to see different issues that face people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to see the Power Of User Groups!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to understand how decisions are made with regards to the future of Java&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You want to meet like-minded people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UGdIjKFq2Bc/UG9HfCm94UI/AAAAAAAALM4/rXbL-X-VPeI/s1600/Vegas.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UGdIjKFq2Bc/UG9HfCm94UI/AAAAAAAALM4/rXbL-X-VPeI/s400/Vegas.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The Exhibitors Hall was like Vegas! But there was a buzz which was infectious&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh there&#39;s millions more, and even if you only tick one of those reasons, I personally think it&#39;s a great way to get a better understanding of the language we use every day as developers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And finally, some of my sessions will be available, audio and slides only, via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone&#34;&gt;content catalog&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Look for the following:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;UGF10467 - Benefits of Open Source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CON3732 - Concurrent Programming with the Disruptor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CON5130 - London Java Community: How to Change the World&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CON11338 - The Problem with Women: A Technical Approach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday dawned, with a sense of foreboding (actually it dawned with me coughing my lungs out, but we&amp;rsquo;ve heard enough about the sub-optimal state of my respiratory system this week).   On this day, I was giving the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2012/06/subject-of-women-programmers-is-boring.html&#34;&gt;talk I was dreading&lt;/a&gt; when I got asked to do it.  It&amp;rsquo;s the talk I actually put more work into than any of the other sessions I was presenting at this JavaOne.  It was the Women In IT talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s timely, given that conference season has one again led to cries of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cerianjenkins.me/2012/10/02/insight-of-an-intern-sexism-in-tech/&#34;&gt;sexism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.jessitron.com/2012/09/this-is-not-ok.html&#34;&gt;discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.  So although I really hate banging on about the subject (you&amp;rsquo;d never believe it from my blog) it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel, and have felt for a long time, that &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/on-how-not-to-target-girl-geeks.html&#34;&gt;the way we&amp;rsquo;re approaching the &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; of the lack of women techies is just wrong.  &lt;i&gt;Obviously&lt;/i&gt; painting stuff pink is just not going to cut it (I hope that&amp;rsquo;s obvious).  I think the fundamental problem is that we keep thinking about women.  While that should be great for someone like me, it actually triggers a whole bunch of gender stereotyping in our poor human brains which prevents us seeing the big picture - the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re not attractive as an industry for women suggests we&amp;rsquo;re losing a whole heap of talent because of some sort of image problem.  We just don&amp;rsquo;t see the other missing minorities, or we&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable talking about them.  I mean, can you image running a session about attracting more black people into programming?  I suspect there would be uproar in singling out a minority based on something as arbitrary as skin colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, even before the session there was a tiny bit of controversy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JgSVCSZexEg/UG3fuhHgeuI/AAAAAAAALLg/FYubozFuf-E/s1600/pmonks.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JgSVCSZexEg/UG3fuhHgeuI/AAAAAAAALLg/FYubozFuf-E/s1600/pmonks.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice though to see guys (because indeed this was someone of the male persuasion) getting upset at the thought of someone taking a shot at the girls again.  I think it probably would have been a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; more helpful to the session if they&amp;rsquo;d put my name on it&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the publicity helped, because there was a really decent turnout for the talk.  I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at estimating numbers, and of course I completely forgot to take a photo of my lovely audience.  But I&amp;rsquo;d say there were&amp;hellip; 60? 80? people there?  Between 50 and 100 anyway, and seemed like a roughly even split of men and women, and there were people of different backgrounds.  Which is great, it&amp;rsquo;s more women than you normally see at a conference, and more men than you usually see at an event talking about &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rsquo;s issues&amp;rdquo;.  I really love running sessions about this subject with guys there, I&amp;rsquo;m of the opinion that talking about this with just women is almost completely useless, and isolates us from the rest of our community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the novel approach of actually trying to treat the problem the same way coders treat any problem: break it down logically.  So I had the problem, the requirements, a retrospective, and the aim was to come up with a list of tasks going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; from Oracle was great as our &amp;ldquo;Business Analyst&amp;rdquo; - not only did he outline the business value in increasing diversity in the workplace:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater pool of talent to hire from&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Happier and more productive employees&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater retention rates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;He also gave examples of how this is a bigger problem than just &amp;ldquo;Women in IT&amp;rdquo; - he spoke about being the outsider as an American who had relocated to Sweden, and how he benefitted from being in a country that recognises a father&amp;rsquo;s rights when his daughter was born there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9RVDN6uDE8/UG3mH1ykffI/AAAAAAAALL4/xwpuhtMpvTY/s1600/TrishaRetrospective.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K9RVDN6uDE8/UG3mH1ykffI/AAAAAAAALL4/xwpuhtMpvTY/s400/TrishaRetrospective.jpg&#34; width=&#34;298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;At LMAX we&amp;rsquo;re super-Agile (something we&amp;rsquo;ll actually be talking about at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home&#34;&gt;Devoxx&lt;/a&gt; this year), so the logical thing to do is to have a retrospective.  The question was somewhat fluffy - tell me about working as a techie, specific points about being female not essential.  So as with all our retrospectives, we covered good points, bad points, questions and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;Incidentally, loads of people there knew about Agile methods and many were using them at work. Does this mean that agile is now more-or-less the norm?  Does it mean that companies that encourage people to go to conferences are agile or agile-friendly companies?  Or does it mean that people who care about people (i.e. those that go to a session like this) are more drawn to Agile methods? &amp;lt;/aside&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m wearing trainers to present, for the very first time! Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CeciliaBorg/&#34;&gt;Cecilia Borg&lt;/a&gt; for taking the photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((Also, special super-thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/steveonjava&#34;&gt;Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; who saved my presentation by sneaking in with a flipchart, stand and pens literally seconds before I needed it))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the audience came up with really great points about working as a techie.  The thing I found most interesting was that very little of it was gender-specific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Negatives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Pink it and Shrink it&amp;rdquo;

with person pretty much everywhere, and it becomes clear that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be trying to work out the problems that face women, but instead be working harder to attract more awesome people into the job we love (I asked who in the room really hated the job, and one person half put his hand up.  So as techies, we generally like what we do), and to look after everyone who&amp;rsquo;s here already as well.  So that lead on to the actions we could do to help this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look elsewhere for technical talent (e.g. people with craft skills are creative and practical)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should be more actively networking (join your local &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.java.net/jugs/java-user-groups&#34;&gt;JUG&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get them young - go to schools and show kids what we do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenge stereotypes - we&amp;rsquo;re not geeks who live at home and code in our bedrooms, we&amp;rsquo;re collaborative and creative individuals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need more role models of all flavours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible education - it should be cheaper to make &amp;ldquo;mistakes&amp;rdquo; - e.g. to switch degrees or to cross-train from other qualifications, we can&amp;rsquo;t be limited by choices we made so young&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work experience to give kids/young people a taste of different jobs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage / expect children to ask questions, more than just learning the school curriculum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy kids technology e.g. raspberry pi, arduino&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show our faces, we are all role models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be vocal about our passions.  We love this job, let&amp;rsquo;s tell people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I felt extremely positive at the end of the session, I think guys saw some of the attitudes that affect women, and women saw that guys were not only sympathetic to our &amp;ldquo;plight&amp;rdquo;, but that they suffer discrimination too.  Basically we&amp;rsquo;re all in this together, and talking gender specifically is sometimes dividing us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;One observation that I loved was that one guy&amp;rsquo;s wife wanted their daughter to do what he does because he loves his job, and she sees hers as a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0cm;&#34;&gt;I also had a number of spin-off conversations later, as always happens when people are dead interested, and a really good point someone raised is that as techies we&amp;rsquo;re frequently the odd one out, the outsider, in a group of &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; people.  We&amp;rsquo;re actually quite used to it and pretty much embrace it. So if anything we&amp;rsquo;re an industry which will be more tolerant of your outsider-ness (as a woman, as someone who looks different) than more traditional jobs.  It&amp;rsquo;s a thought, and an attitude we should perhaps publish more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three things I think we should do as individuals are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Take The Plunge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women in particularly, but all of you who don&amp;rsquo;t think you can be That Person - start talking at conferences, start writing blogs, start a new user group if you haven&amp;rsquo;t got one, go into schools.  Be that role model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Don&amp;rsquo;t Point Out Her Gender&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the guys mean well, and women are guilty of this too, but don&amp;rsquo;t highlight to a women at a conference/interview/meetup when you meet her for the first time that she&amp;rsquo;s female.  She knows this. It&amp;rsquo;s almost always said in a positive way (&amp;ldquo;Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s great that you&amp;rsquo;re here, we don&amp;rsquo;t see many women in these parts&amp;rdquo;), and I know you mean it to be encouraging.  But it just highlights how different she is, not how awesome it is she&amp;rsquo;s doing the same thing you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. What We Do Is Awesome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re here because we like what we do, we get paid for doing our hobbies.  Not many people can boast of that.  We need to get out there and tell people how much fun it is to be a techie.  Don&amp;rsquo;t let the Hollywood geek stereotype be the only image people have of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a really good time, and I came out feeling very positive about my job, my industry, and the people who do this.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to run this session again if I get the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;EDIT: The &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone#loadSearch-event=javaone&amp;amp;searchPhrase=CON11338&amp;amp;searchType=session&amp;amp;tc=0&amp;amp;sortBy=&amp;amp;p=&amp;amp;i(11424)=&amp;amp;i(10050)=&amp;amp;i(10090)=&amp;amp;i(10092)=&amp;amp;i(11842)=&amp;amp;i(10086)=&#34;&gt;slides and audio&lt;/a&gt; are available.  The content catalog is a little counter-intuitive to use, hopefully that link will take you to a page with this session title on - click on it and there&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;media&amp;rdquo; on the pop up window.  This session doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself well to audio because of the audience participation aspect but I do repeat most of the points and you get a feel for the session.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this is exciting!  JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve covered the same conference two years running.  I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/javaone-2011-roundup.html&#34;&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; it was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt; folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;m here with several other &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; people, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to be a member of the Alumni, to have the privilege of showing other guys around and introducing people to each other.  It&amp;rsquo;s nice to run into people I met here for the first time last year, some of whom I&amp;rsquo;ve had a chance to see at other events this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Sunday, is an interesting day.  The focus is on community, so I get to hear what other JUGs are doing, some of their pain points, and learn some of the things they&amp;rsquo;re doing that maybe we should think about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lm0BeJifdNs/UGnYYDgNbVI/AAAAAAAALKI/rWANg1dfTks/s1600/DSC_0279.JPG&#34;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The day started well, with Jim and Richard de-mystifying the business and technology terminology we&amp;rsquo;re bound to come across at this conference.  8:15am is a really harsh time to have to do your first presentation, but it had a good turnout and was a great way to kick off the conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;I followed this with a talk about why you would open source your secrets, a short presentation detailing the benefits to your business of opening up parts of your codebase.  It went better than expected, given my voice has all but disappeared due to a stupid cold and plane travel and jet lag (and noisy bars).  I had contingency plans on how to present via typing or drawing on my iPad, but in the end I managed even despite the microphone not being turned on.  Doh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y3i2xpoKxdM/UGnapgQNiiI/AAAAAAAALKQ/SRkBw51f9Kk/s1600/DSC_0289.JPG&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a series of presentations on how to make your JUG successful and how to run Adopt a JSR/OpenJDK programmes in your user group, before &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; and I had to dash off to the public EC meeting.  This was not as well-attended as last year, but it meant that I had a chance to talk to all the EC members, and to drink more free champagne than one really ought to in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

width=&#34;214&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Next on the packed schedule was a trip to yet another location (seriously, that&amp;rsquo;s 4 different locations just on Sunday) for the keynotes.  Note: next time I say &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not far, let&amp;rsquo;s walk&amp;rdquo; in San Francisco, hit me with sticks.  That&amp;rsquo;s the second time in as many days I&amp;rsquo;ve been hit with a vertical distance that was further than the horizontal.  At least this time I wasn&amp;rsquo;t wheeling my luggage up the hill like I was on Friday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The keynotes were definitely better than last year.  I really enjoyed how the technical keynote put the shiny new stuff into an everyday context - seeing JavaFX running on all the platforms, including embedded, and seeing lambdas used in anger, was really engaging.  In my mind, it&amp;rsquo;s much more likely to get &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; developers using these things.  I particularly enjoyed the interplay between Mark Reinhold and Brian Goetz, it&amp;rsquo;s great to see people like that so passionate about what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, it really humanizes them and their projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODxw1aQyY-E/UGnlEk2QI4I/AAAAAAAALK8/DLZYaOE33kI/s1600/DSC_0311.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The last trip of the day was back down the hill to one of the many parties scheduled this week.  Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not in every party that you get given an award, so this was particularly sweet - the London Java Community has been honoured with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.java.net/dukeschoice&#34;&gt;Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the first year a community has won a &amp;ldquo;Dukey&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to be part of a group of people who are actively contributing to the language I work with daily, and to be recognised for this.  So yes, I was on stage getting an award again.  It&amp;rsquo;s addictive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a really great kick off to this year&amp;rsquo;s JavaOne, and I&amp;rsquo;m back at the apartment well before my coach (well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://uber.com/invite/w2rk7&#34;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt;) turns into a pumpkin and resting my voice in time for my Disruptor presentation tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nkfHDUEb_qU/UGnlcHCHk-I/AAAAAAAALLE/gCqr9CtoGk4/s1600/DSC_0316.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

            <title>The Strange Loop</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week (was it only last week?) I was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://thestrangeloop.com/&#34;&gt;Strange Loop&lt;/a&gt;, presenting a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/strangeloop-disruptor-workshop-materials.html&#34;&gt;workshop on the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s1600/hotel.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jt5DFeC5wNo/UGee7BSeo3I/AAAAAAAALJY/le-weiSydUs/s320/hotel.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been before and, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before.  So everything was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a very geeky conference.  I mean that as a compliment, of course.  Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&amp;rsquo;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.  The themes I mostly saw were functional programming and the (insert horribly abused term) Big Data space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So nothing about Spring and Hibernate or any of their ilk, of course.  Almost nothing about Java actually, as if a language that is actually used by millions of developers is somehow too passé.  But this was extremely liberating - if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that&amp;rsquo;s going to be applicable to my day job, I can go and see talks on things I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in.  That&amp;rsquo;s not to say the day job is not interesting, of course, but removing the constraint meant the only criteria for selecting talks was &amp;ldquo;Will I learn something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite talk was Jeff Hawkins&amp;rsquo; keynote, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/computing-like-the-brain&#34;&gt;Computing Like the Brain&lt;/a&gt;.  It was as if he was trying to download several decades of research on neuroscience into our brains in less than 30 minutes.  It was incredible!  Fascinating, and the stuff of science fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s1600/foyer.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QaupZv7WIN0/UGeh0uLL_qI/AAAAAAAALJw/4GKastaWFvM/s320/foyer.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The quality of speakers was really good, big names that many would recognise, all talking about their passions.  And it was another friendly conference, where lots of people appeared to be there on their own, and were happy to get chatting to randoms like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of people too.  I had expected it to be quite a small, intimate conference.  But while it&amp;rsquo;s not JavaOne, there were a lot more people than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been to St Louis before either.  However, since I voluntarily spent all my time between the hotel and the venue, I think I can safely say I still haven&amp;rsquo;t really been there.  But &lt;a href=&#34;http://peabodyoperahouse.com/&#34;&gt;the venue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/stlus-st-louis-union-station-marriott/&#34;&gt;the hotel&lt;/a&gt; were really beautiful places, as well as being dead conveniently placed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I enjoyed Strange Loop.  It was a little strange, and I was out of my comfort zone, but I had an interesting time and met yet more great people.  I&amp;rsquo;d love to go again next year, if I get the chance (hint hint).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Strangeloop Disruptor Workshop Materials</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/strangeloop_disruptor_workshop_materials/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 26 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/strangeloop_disruptor_workshop_materials/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I gave my very first workshop on the Disruptor.  The aim was to give people some hands-on coding experience using the syntax.  Because time was limited (you can&amp;rsquo;t get people to build an entire application architecture in 2.5 hours) the example is somewhat contrived, and needs a big leap to make it into a proper application context.  But the workshop should:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give an overview of the Disruptor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show how to create a simple one producer, one consumer example.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show how to wire up a parallel event handler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show how to how (and why) to create a diamond dependency graph.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extrapolate beyond these very simple examples to something closer to a real world architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Requirements are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic Java skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html&#34;&gt;Java 7 update 7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Optionally) &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;The slides (not all that useful, I&amp;rsquo;ll grant you, without me talking) are available, and you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://db.tt/9AjcSh1m&#34;&gt;download the code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you want to work through the examples yourself, start with &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;com.mechanitis.towerdefense.TowerDefence&lt;/span&gt;.  The starting point code for the workshop is in package &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;com.mechanitis.towerdefense&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;com.mechanitis.towerdefense1&lt;/span&gt; shows a solution to exercise one, &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;com.mechanitis.towerdefense2&lt;/span&gt; to exercise 2 and so forth.  The final package, &lt;span style=&#34;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&#34;&gt;com.mechanitis.towerdefense4&lt;/span&gt;, has some different towers you can play with to see the effects.  They don&amp;rsquo;t really show anything special about the Disruptor, but they were fun to write and are interesting to play with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14458348?hostedIn=slideshare&amp;amp;page=upload&#34; width=&#34;476&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Upcoming Events</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_events/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_events/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So yeah&amp;hellip; in keeping with this year&amp;rsquo;s theme of basically only blogging about the exciting conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to,
I&amp;rsquo;m going to blog about the exciting conferences I am attending in the future. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been great at doing that,
the disconnect between the time I submit a presentation and the actual announcement means that I often forget I haven&amp;rsquo;t told anyone about what I&amp;rsquo;m up to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I&amp;rsquo;m back in the States this month to present my very first workshop - &lt;a href=&#34;https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/concurrent-programming-using-the-disruptor&#34;&gt;An Introduction to the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; at Strangeloop.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been given a mere 6 months to prepare it (note: sarcasm) and it&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress.  So, if you&amp;rsquo;re coming, feel free to suggest things you want to see covered.  If you are coming, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I&amp;rsquo;m back in the States again a minute and a half later for several presentations at JavaOne.  I really enjoyed JavaOne last year, it was my first international conference, my first speaking gig, and a great place to meet loads of dead interesting people.  This year I&amp;rsquo;m being greedy and I&amp;rsquo;m doing more than one talk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sun 30th Sept: UGF10467 - Benefits of Open Source &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mon 1st Oct: CON3732 - Concurrent Programming with the Disruptor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wed 3rd Oct: CON5130 - London Java Community: How to Change the World&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wed 3rd Oct: CON11338 - The Problem with Women: A Technical Approach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid the content catalog totally confounds me, so I can&amp;rsquo;t link to each talk specifically, but you should be able to search on the identifiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        Then I&amp;rsquo;m back on home turf, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/2012/sessions/?tid=2604#session-22064&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt;, doing the Disruptor talk yet again.  I always enjoy JAX, it has a lot of participation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; members, it attracts an international set of speakers and it&amp;rsquo;s right on my doorstep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;d really, really like to go to Devoxx again this year, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been confirmed yet.  I&amp;rsquo;ll do everything in my power to be there, but no promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right.  I suppose I had better get back to writing this workshop&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed at GOTO Copenhagen, about Java, the Disruptor, the Graduate Developer Community &amp;amp; London Java Community, and a whole host of other things.  So to make up for the lack of blogging this month, here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/0OcczjVXQQc&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I attended (one way or another) two events last week that got me thinking&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The first was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23066&#34;&gt;Girl Developers will Save the World&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- a session that had me a little confused as to whether that referred to me, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;girls, i.e. those that are not yet legally classed as adults.&amp;nbsp; The second was the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://remarkablewomen.co.uk/post/27487174154/has-social-media-given-women-a-louder-voice&#34;&gt;Remarkable Women Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;party the following day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Firstly, a caveat/disclaimer (as usual) - both events were useful, thought-provoking and overall worthwhile.&amp;nbsp; But the alarming thing to me was the number of times I heard &#34;boys are…&#34; or &#34;women think…&#34; or &#34;girls prefer…&#34;.&amp;nbsp; And I know we often make generalisations to stress a point, but I&#39;m becoming extremely wary of statements that group people together along some arbitrary boundaries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;&#34;Google+ failed because it&#39;s design by men for men&#34; - no, it&#39;s because it&#39;s not designed for anyone. &amp;nbsp;Its only purpose was to compete with Facebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;&#34;Women are better at communicating and social activities&#34; - what, all of us?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m better at communicating than every man I&#39;ve ever met?&amp;nbsp; Than someone like Obama or Steve Jobs or John Stewart?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;&#34;Women do better with female role models&#34; - where are the statistics?&amp;nbsp; And do men do better with male role models, or do they do better with female role models too because women are so much &#34;better at communicating&#34;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;m not saying these statements aren&#39;t ever true.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not even saying they&#39;re not true &#34;most&#34; of the time (although I want to see proof).&amp;nbsp; But any kind of strategy based on gross generalisations had better take into account the fact that these are generalisations, that they are based on Statistics&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(and sometimes not even those), and that they frequently correspond nicely to things we&#39;d&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to think or we are trained to think.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Humans are great at categorising.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a survival skill - &#34;yummy&#34;, &#34;warm&#34;, &#34;safe&#34;, &#34;funny coloured = hurty tummy&#34;, &#34;things with sharp pointy teethies like to eat me&#34;.&amp;nbsp; Without this skill we wouldn&#39;t have made it as a species.&amp;nbsp; And marketing people, who have to use psychology to get us to part with our money, understand this.&amp;nbsp; They identify trends and target their shinies to these trends (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuppie&#34;&gt;Yuppie&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomer&#34;&gt;Baby Boomer&lt;/a&gt;, etc).&amp;nbsp; By identifying these groups and aiming at them, they make them real. &amp;nbsp;And since humans are a clan-based society, who (again for evolutionary reasons) need to fit in with their gang, these groups become aspirational.&amp;nbsp; Essex people drive BMWs and wear white stilettos?&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t and I live in Essex, oh no! I&#39;d better get on that right away, otherwise people will see I&#39;m An Imposter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So when people go around saying &#34;Women are great at communicating&#34;, we believe it.&amp;nbsp; Those of us who are a bit sucky at it or maybe don&#39;t care about it wonder if we&#39;re&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/on-similarities-between-girls-and.html&#34;&gt;aliens&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or we believe we&#39;re great at it because we should be, and we don&#39;t work at improving our skills.&amp;nbsp; Men are terrible at cleaning?&amp;nbsp; Great!&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have to clean the toilet!&amp;nbsp; Women&#39;s minds aren&#39;t programmed for engineering because they&#39;re more communicaty than logical?&amp;nbsp; Fine, I&#39;ll teach physics instead of using it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;If I hear one more person say women don&#39;t do well in IT because they prefer more soft-skill-based roles, I&#39;m going to scream. In that case, why are there more women entering accountancy than men? In that case, how do men ever get to manage people, and why does pair programming work so well?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;If I hear once more that men put women off these roles because of the macho male environment, I&#39;m going to drag that person through a tour of every office I&#39;ve worked in - I&#39;m constantly disappointed that my male colleagues enjoy football even less than than the girls I went to school with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So, using stereotypes to try and address things like gender disparity in IT is not going to work. &amp;nbsp;The men in our industry are not beer-swilling, football-watching, womanising alpha males. &amp;nbsp;So why, when we talk about the missing women in our industry, do we assume they will be pink-obsessed, fashion-conscious, gossipy socialites who only hang around with other women? &amp;nbsp;Do you even know any women like that? &amp;nbsp;This is not Desperate Housewives, this is Real Life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good marketing people don&#39;t target people as they are - no-one wants to be considered poor - you&#39;re a bargain hunter or great at identifying value. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, if you want women to use your product or &amp;nbsp;work for your company, you don&#39;t target to weight-obsessed, soap-opera-watching, child-caring fashionistas. &amp;nbsp;Instead you target how a person wants to be seen. &amp;nbsp;You might say using your product or working for your company makes a person look smart, savvy and awesome. &amp;nbsp;And who doesn&#39;t want to be all of those things?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying people in IT are sexy and intelligent and earn loads of money and have oodles of job options and can find work globally &lt;i style=&#34;background-color: white;&#34;&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be a compelling story for people.&amp;nbsp; Some of those people might even be women.&amp;nbsp; Some of them might even be the other missing minorities&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Thinking in stereotypes can be damaging to everyone. &amp;nbsp;Gender stereotypes in both directions are so sweeping they are unhelpful, you can&#39;t categorise fully half of the world&#39;s population as one thing or another. &amp;nbsp;I hear men doing men a disservice by saying things that aren&#39;t even true for themselves, and the same for women. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s something we&#39;re trained to do, and something the media loves to do. &amp;nbsp;But it&#39;s wrong. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;So the next time you find yourself saying &#34;men&amp;nbsp;prefer...&#34; or &#34;women are...&#34;, stop and think if this is actually true for all of the men and women you know. &amp;nbsp;And if it&#39;s not, just don&#39;t say it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics&#34;&gt;Lies, damned dies and…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>OSCON Day One</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/oscon_day_one/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/oscon_day_one/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my first day at my very first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012&#34;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt;.  I have to say that when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt; told me I &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to do OSCON, that it was one of &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; conferences to go to, I was sceptical - not because I thought it would be rubbish, but because I have enjoyed all the conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The program&lt;/b&gt; is packed with great topics and speakers, and so many things I want to see that clash with each other.  It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating, and all the sessions get in the way of all that networking stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The people&lt;/b&gt; are so friendly.  They smile at you randomly in the corridor.  They talk to you for no reason.  As a Londoner it comes as a bit of a shock to the system.  And it&amp;rsquo;s nice!  Great conversations with different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The venue&lt;/b&gt; is set up for these encounters with plenty of places to sit with the laptop or mingle or meet and sit with people at lunchtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The exhibition area&lt;/b&gt; is not a total waste of time!  The booths are full of educated people not selling me &amp;ldquo;solutions&amp;rdquo; that I have no power to implement in my company, but engaging me in conversation about things that interest me as a developer.  Many of these are even useful for my day job - who knew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the sessions are being streamed so if you&amp;rsquo;re not here, I highly recommend that - from what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so far the quality of the video is good and it&amp;rsquo;s the next best thing to actually being here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m inspired, actually.  It&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that Open Source is key to our industry.  Not just because of the technologies that have been created that help power some of our most successful companies.  But because with only the love of the thing you&amp;rsquo;re doing to motivate the developers, community / cooperation / people / soft-fluffy-stuff is fundamental to success.  Talks here have highlighted to me that there are lessons that money-making companies can learn from this community around how to motivate your developers.  There are even lessons I have learnt today around how to improve relationships in my personal life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this community the poster child for our industry?  Why isn&amp;rsquo;t this the entry point for everyone interested in development?  I know we say (even I&amp;rsquo;ve said it myself) that contributing to a project is a great way to advance your career, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re junior.  But we can also showcase some of the really interesting stuff about being a developer by using the open source community - communication, cooperation, and working on cool stuff. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it that even within our industry, the open source community is seen as being niche, and difficult to get into?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>The subject of women programmers is boring</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/the_subject_of_women_programmers_is_boring/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming.  Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The problem with these sessions is that you&amp;rsquo;re preaching to the choir.  Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause.  People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&amp;rsquo;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;This tends to lead to the same types of sessions - yes, our industry under-represents certain segments of society (i.e. women); yes, we all agree this is a problem; yes, everyone in this room is trying their best to do the right things; no, we have no idea how to fix it at the industry-level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;These sessions are &lt;i&gt;boring&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;How do you make this subject interesting, relevant, and appeal to the types of people it really should target?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m considering all sorts of games with the title, even going so far as to put &amp;ldquo;Boobs&amp;rdquo; in it.  I &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; much doubt that will make my final selection.  I&amp;rsquo;m thinking hard about the format, I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be preachy, I want it to be informative, collaborative, and, preferably, funny.  Not too much to ask, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;In programming, if something is difficult to do right, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of a smell - the feature being requested might be contrary to the purpose of the product; the application might not have been designed around the business&amp;rsquo;s real requirements; there could be a large amount of tech debt that should have been cleaned up along the way but wasn&amp;rsquo;t; the requirements might be fluffy, changeable, or simply outright wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Does the fact that we can&amp;rsquo;t get these sessions right point to a smell as well?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Are they pitched at the wrong people?  Are we saying the wrong things, suggesting the wrong ideas, tackling the wrong problem?  Should we even be talking about women in technology?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Or am I just the wrong person to do it?  I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to be the spokesperson for women developers.  I can only be the spokesperson for me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Overall I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think we&amp;rsquo;re missing the point again.  If I think that events aimed at girls are wrong, then I think that sessions at conferences aimed at highlighting the missing women there is also wrong.  But this is a great audience to reach - these are people who want to further their careers, who are likely to be putting in extra hours to improve themselves/their company/the industry.  Give a techy a tricky problem to gnaw on and there&amp;rsquo;s no-one happier.  And what could be more tricky than the seemingly-unsolvable problem of attracting greater diversity into technical roles?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The answer might lie in shaping the problem such that it is interesting enough, difficult enough and technical enough for us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Or maybe the answer is simply accepting the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re not going to change those who are part of the problem, but you can change the message you are giving.  I know many men are tired of being berated about this issue because they&amp;rsquo;re already doing the best they can.  I know many women are bored of hearing about it because they&amp;rsquo;re already here.  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the problem differently and suggest an alternative approach.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;If only I knew what that was&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Overheard: Development Myths</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/overheard_development_myths/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/overheard_development_myths/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don&amp;rsquo;t Think I Agree With.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To developers technologies are everything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again.  Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this true?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure.  And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.  But I&amp;rsquo;d be worried if I thought that 99% of developers were like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our day jobs, and also if we want to create something that makes any money, we need to be interested in solving people&amp;rsquo;s problems and creating solutions.  Sure, we&amp;rsquo;ll use technology to do that.  But if we were all only motivated by technology, we&amp;rsquo;d always be trying out the Next Big Thing when our customers wanted a simple CRUD web app.  Any organisation that encouraged this sort of technology um, infidelity?  playing the field? might find themselves with lots of fascinated and broadly-educated developers, but not a lot of productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought developers were drawn by wrestling with the machine to solve a particular problem, or to do something that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done before.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t think we liked learning Ruby because we didn&amp;rsquo;t study it at university, or switching to a functional language simply because that&amp;rsquo;s the way the whole world is going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We can train The Business to speak our language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a number of people talking about the Holy Grail of having business owners write acceptance tests.  At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; we have a (Java-based) DSL that theoretically could allow technical-ish non-developers to write our automated acceptance tests.  However, is this the right thing to do?  To make our jobs easier, and our code better quality, we need the business to become almost developers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our (very difficult) job as developers is to act as translator between the ones and zeros a computer speaks and the real life doman language our business guys (and girls) use.  Forcing the business to become more technical is just, well, lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if our business people shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be forced to become more technical, how can we bridge the gap?  Is there anything that we as developers can do to move closer to the business?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321125215&#34;&gt;Ubiquitous Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321125215&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; is a good start.  When a business user talks about an order, a developer should be thinking about the Order class, or something that implements an Order interface.  When the business talks about placing an order, a developer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thinking &amp;ldquo;place order translates into the execute method&amp;rdquo;, they should assume there&amp;rsquo;s a placeOrder method somewhere they can use as a start point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We certainly shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be training the head of sales to start talking in terms of Java classes or technologies - &amp;ldquo;I want the Resin tier to validate the order while the OrderMatcherImpl checks for availability&amp;rdquo;.  That would be silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Development is hard, that&amp;rsquo;s why they pay us.  And part of that hard job is learning the business model we&amp;rsquo;re implementing so we can mirror and support the business.  We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be inflicting our technology on the business.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to &lt;a href=&#34;http://010dev.nl/post/social-tech-event-the-disruptor-and-the-perfect-programmer&#34;&gt;present to a brand new community&lt;/a&gt; of developers.  I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&amp;rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.  Frankly it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m keen to do more of.  Due to a total technology fail on the part of all of us, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the projector working with any of the various laptops.  However, with 30-odd techies, free wireless and slides &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/concurrent-programming-using-the-disruptor-copenhagen&#34;&gt;available on Slideshare&lt;/a&gt;, we managed a novel and collaborative presentation approach, with people clustered around the laptops with the largest screens, and someone at each one valiantly keeping up with my quick pace through over 100 slides of stick-men drawings (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.objectify.be/wordpress/?p=488&#34;&gt;a review of the evening is available&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed it, it was quite a change of pace from the conferences - my first attempt at presenting after imbibing probably a little toooo much wine, and a much more intimate venue which encouraged a lot of questions and discussion.  It&amp;rsquo;s actually a format that worked, and maybe there&amp;rsquo;s a way to get it to work even more smoothly, if the slides on all the laptops were synchronised, and there was some way for me to gesture wildly at the appropriate parts of the slides like I do when I&amp;rsquo;m on stage.  Hmmm, maybe that&amp;rsquo;s actually a webcast now I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had an excellent time, thanks to the hospitality of the rather awesome Rotterdam-ians.  What I found fascinating  - as well as the venue and the novel presenting style - is the formation of a group of people with broadly similar interests.  One of the great strengths of a place like London is its size - you will find a number of people here with interests like yours, and sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/&#34;&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt; make it ridiculously easy to find them.  One of the weaknesses of London, however, is its size - there are so many people you could attract that you end up narrowing your search field.  You pick a very specific technology, a tiny geographical area, a single interest, to build a community around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a while it would be nice to have a community of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t all the same, who share overlapping but different passions.  But how do you create something like that?  You need a single thing to draw those people together, otherwise they&amp;rsquo;ll never find each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In smaller cities the geography limits the numbers, so you can have a broader range of interests represented.  In London, I can see something as (relatively) specific as a Java User Group becoming even more specific.  With nearly 2500 members, you could easily spin off Java-for-banking, Java-for-gaming, Java-in-west-London-zone-2 etc etc.  In fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve already spawned off a number of groups like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/grad-dc/&#34;&gt;Graduate Developer Community&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-scala/&#34;&gt;London Scala Users&amp;rsquo; Group&lt;/a&gt; and so forth.  With nearly 2500 members, you cannot possibly meet them all, you can&amp;rsquo;t even get a feel for what everyone&amp;rsquo;s into.  How do you get the intimacy from a smaller user group without narrowing the scope so much that all of you might as well be clones?  The awesome thing about user groups is coming across new ideas, seeing solutions to problems you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know existed, hearing about things people are working on that never occurred to you.  For that, you need diversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one of the nice things about a city as large as London is you get plenty of diversity.  But how do you pull together that diversity?  How do you create a group that is diverse, when by necessity you need something central for those people to gravitate towards?  And if the diversity creates a large group, how do you create intimacy and feel personally involved, the stuff that comes for free if you belong to a smaller group where you know everyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Rotterdam, at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/in-which-i-defend-male-species-at-all.html&#34;&gt;Girl Geek meetup&lt;/a&gt;, I saw the advantage of using something other than a specific technology to gather together a group of interesting people - you get a wider range of experiences and passions.  How you can achieve this without using geography or genetics to select your participants?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it even possible to build a community when your goal is diversity?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; presentation I gave at QCon London is now available on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Concurrent-Programming-Using-The-Disruptor#.T8-KKWLH1R4.blogger&#34;&gt;InfoQ site&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the same presentation as the one I gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/new-disruptor-presentation-unveiled-to.html&#34;&gt;Skillsmatter in March&lt;/a&gt;, but the questions are different.  Plus since I&amp;rsquo;m winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Three airports and three hotels in a week, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I&amp;rsquo;m coming or going.  Add to that a mere four hours sleep last night, and this might resemble the ramblings of a mad woman (more than usual that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;GOTO Amsterdam was a different affair to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/goto-copenhagen.html&#34;&gt;GOTO Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, which is not necessarily a bad thing - it&amp;rsquo;s great that the events have their own personalities and aren&amp;rsquo;t cookie cutter versions of the same thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5oo5Q4AQp0/T8con_3hw9I/AAAAAAAAKpg/Hib3iGCinqg/s1600/Conference.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;213&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h5oo5Q4AQp0/T8con_3hw9I/AAAAAAAAKpg/Hib3iGCinqg/s320/Conference.JPG&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Great communal area for meeting people, in a unique venue&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Amsterdam was smaller and shorter, and therefore felt even more intimate than Copenhagen, which didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly feel massive either.  The venue was beautiful and imposing (and not at all air conditioned!), which I think also contributed to its unique feeling; the timetable felt less intense (although both conferences had a reminder that the next session was going to start, great for moving people at the right times); there was a different mix of attendees and speakers (fewer Danes and more Dutch for a start); and the coffee was marginally better in Amsterdam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Both conferences were very friendly, but Amsterdam felt even friendlier - possibly because it was smaller, or maybe it was me because I was already in the Conference Zone, but people were coming up to chat to me from the very first minute, which is great for a shy person like me&amp;hellip;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Java Track&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ShggZ_UOlLo/T8coWrOEuRI/AAAAAAAAKpY/qGb33ah4LZ8/s1600/SimplePureJava.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ShggZ_UOlLo/T8coWrOEuRI/AAAAAAAAKpY/qGb33ah4LZ8/s400/SimplePureJava.JPG&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Anton Keks demonstrating simplicity in Java&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I was very pleased to see Anton Keks kick off the Java track with a talk to pull us developers back to reality.  Instead of running off to find a shiny new language to fix our problems, we can toss away overblown frameworks and enterprise architecture and write nice, simple Java.  We can even go against basic conventions to make our code more terse and readable.  While I&amp;rsquo;m not sold on all suggestions (e.g. not using curly braces for single-line if statements) I&amp;rsquo;m totally behind the theory, and it led nicely into my Disruptor presentation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;At Amsterdam, rather than being relegated to a smaller room up a lot of stairs, my Disruptor talk was in the main, grand hall. This is not always a Good Thing, because standing on a large stage tends to separate you from the audience, and one of the things I like to do is have a lot of questions and interaction from the audience.  I think I pulled it off better than I have in the past, just because I was aware of the problem.  I even forced some of the audience to move from the back to closer to the front to give the illusion of intimacy - I totally didn&amp;rsquo;t expect hat to work!  The session went really well and I got good feedback - it might actually have gone better than in Copenhagen, but I think having given the same presentation the previous day probably helped.  And although I like having it videoed so more people get a chance to look at it, it&amp;rsquo;s nice when it isn&amp;rsquo;t - you don&amp;rsquo;t feel the pressure of having mistakes immortalised and replayed infinitely.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--VvGeUwpUYU/T8coOTWP-aI/AAAAAAAAKpQ/T6SrrqKew4g/s1600/Agile.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right;

width=&#34;267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I missed all of the Agile stuff at Copenhagen, so I tried to make up for it in Amsterdam.  Interestingly I felt like I saw things from two different types of practitioners.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Firstly, you get the war stories of trying to fit agile into an organisation that isn&amp;rsquo;t used to working that way - conferences have been showcasing these for quite a few years now, and it&amp;rsquo;s still really important to continue showing the different types of obstacles and how to overcome them (and why - the benefits you get when it starts to work).  What&amp;rsquo;s different I think is the types of company that are now trying out agile are the sorts of organisation that never would have used it in the past, because it appeared too unstructured and not rigorous enough.  I think this is a good sign of the increasing maturity of agile and its acceptance into common practice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The other types of practitioners are those who&amp;rsquo;ve set up their whole organisation on Agile principals, from the ground up.  These companies are waaaaay ahead of what you read in books, and have problems that are really only just starting to be talked about as these companies grow up and scale up.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; falls into this category, but I was both surprised and pleased to see other organisations doing similar things to us and facing some similar challenges - in the past I felt that we were alone with no-one to learn from, but it seems I was wrong in that.  I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a few ideas I want to take back with me that are certainly worth discussing back at the mothership.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keynotes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The Lego Keynote was interesting, it&amp;rsquo;s fascinating to see how another industry works to balance creativity and constraints (costs, lack of manual dexterity in small children, marketing/branding guidelines etc).  I&amp;rsquo;m still mad at them because of the horrible &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VPRETO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B005VPRETO&#34;&gt;Lego Friends&lt;/a&gt; thing aimed at girls, but I did come out of that thinking I really really want to work for them.  Not sure it actually helped me in my day job….&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The keynote taking lessons out of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061673730/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0061673730&#34;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0061673730&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; was quite thought provoking.  The main things I remember were around combating frustration and boredom - we need to create working environments which allow you to step away from a problem and come back ready to face it again.  And we need to allow ourselves to do this.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Multiple sessions, including this one, talked about flow - how when you&amp;rsquo;re in the zone (as a developer) you can be creative and productive.  Creating environments and processes that not only enable flow but encourage it is going get the most out of your developers.  As a bonus, it&amp;rsquo;s going to attract other great developers to join you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OBmivWmbBFo/T8covv7mNyI/AAAAAAAAKps/sVahiyWaXh8/s1600/Amsterdam.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, after the end of a long week…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Despite the extreme tiredness, the unexpected heat and unwelcome hay fever, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling pretty creative and full of ideas right now.  I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of quite a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to present on - more fluffy things than just the Disruptor - and I&amp;rsquo;ve got some projects I&amp;rsquo;d love to work on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I really hope that survives past moving apartment (today - argh!) and going back to work.  Events like these are designed to make you think and to try and help the industry move forward, it would be a shame to lose that momentum in the every humdrum details of life and work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hSg4QXu7Q-8/T74owAfM8tI/AAAAAAAAKig/di8ST-hj0V0/s1600/alone.png&#34;

width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, &amp;nbsp;before everything gets pushed out of my head, GOTO Copenhagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was my first conference &#34;alone&#34;, in that I didn&#39;t have friends and colleagues from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; or the London Java Community there with me. &amp;nbsp;And certainly at the start of the conference, I wasn&#39;t the only one who was standing around, hoping someone would talk to me (in all honesty some of the photos above are a little unfair - the schedule was a very nice, simple phone app so most people spent a lot of time playing with their phones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It actually turned out to be an advantage to be alone, as I met a lot of interesting new people.&amp;nbsp; I was impressed actually by how local it feels - i.e. many of the speakers and attendees were from Copenhagen or at least Denmark.&amp;nbsp; I liked this, because the alternative is that the conference feels like lots of the usual suspects travelling from place to place, doing the same thing and not really giving much to the city it&#39;s hosted in or getting much out of the location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;There was a bit of noise on Twitter, although not as much as at larger conferences. &amp;nbsp;Actually I think that meant that those who were on Twitter were awesome at connecting up in real life, so I met a bunch of new people who&#39;d originally seen me or spoken to me on Twitter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;War Stories; Coding with the Stars; Coding Using the Disruptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;My sessions were a bit of a mixed bag.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I presented my war story on &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/christmas-decorations-teach-me-lesson.html&#34;&gt;tracking down a performance problem in IE7&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;but the most interesting thing about this session was seeing the other two speakers&#39; war stories.&amp;nbsp; At the end of ten minutes of me talking extremely quickly at the audience, I had no questions - so either my explanation was crystal clear, or I blasted the audience into submission with my caffeine-fuelled nervous energy. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m guessing no-one wanted to ask &#34;Can you repeat all that please?&#34;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;On Wednesday I paired with a member of the audience on a coding kata - I was really hoping to show TDD (old-school, not &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It&#34;&gt;TDD as if you mean it&lt;/a&gt;), a bit of how to pair (i.e. how you communicate during pairing and why it&#39;s dead valuable), and some attempt at showing how you think about your design in a vaguely Domain Driven way.&amp;nbsp; Although I covered all those areas, I think an hour was barely enough to do one of them justice - I think the tension between showing those three things meant I didn&#39;t demo any of them particularly thoroughly or well.&amp;nbsp; Still, the most interesting thing there was comparing my session with Steve Freeman&#39;s, which was directly after - same kata, same language, and totally different approach.&amp;nbsp; What I &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;people got out of this was that there is no One Way to Rule Them All.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;Also, Java is not a good language for getting results in an hour.&amp;nbsp; Sadly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;My main event was my Disruptor presentation using car assembly as an analogy, which readers of the blog may already have seen in one of its previous incarnations. &amp;nbsp;At least this time i didn&#39;t get a red unsmily face on my feedback like I did at QCon London (whoever you are, tell me what you didn&#39;t like!!)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;__ss_13059657&#34;

was interesting, I started off feeling very sneery about some shiny new language from Google, but I ended up wondering if we could us it anywhere within &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1355309262&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;LMAX&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1355309263&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - it&#39;s got curly braces and OO, but it&#39;s Javascripty.&amp;nbsp; In a good way (I think).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I took a lot out of Don Reinertsen&#39;s keynote and his session &#34;The Tactical and Strategic Art of Economic Models&#34;.&amp;nbsp; Maybe it&#39;s just my OCD, but I really like the idea of having actual numbers to allow you to make decisions - understanding the cost of various options as well as the potential gains allows us to make much more informed decisions.&amp;nbsp; In fact, he points out these numbers don&#39;t have to be monetary, but having some uniform way to compare relative costs and benefits of taking certain paths is enough.&amp;nbsp; Even with average (i.e. not terrible) intuition the range of opinions on the cost of something is 50:1 - that&#39;s a big range. &amp;nbsp;And different people will make different choices based on what they think those costs are.&amp;nbsp; Michael T. Nygard&#39;s DevOps talk also uses numbers on cost to make decisions on whether to actually fix a defect or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Rich Hickey&#39;s keynote also gave some food for thought.&amp;nbsp; The main thing I took out of it is that &#34;facts&#34; only have context when associated with a time.&amp;nbsp; This makes total sense to me, and ties in nicely with some of the stuff we do at LMAX - for example, although it&#39;s not specifically time-based, the Disruptor sequence numbers make it clear what&#39;s the most recent event, and ensures ordering and repeatability. &amp;nbsp; It also ties in with some of the stuff in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321601912&#34;&gt;Dave&#39;s Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0321601912&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;   book (sorry Jez, everyone else except LMAX call it Jez&#39;s book) - everything, including your configuration, needs to be in source control or some other managed repository, this way you can always get repeatable builds, because its not just the code that impacts the way your system behaves, it&#39;s your configuration, your dependencies, so on and so forth.&amp;nbsp; Having everything trackable by time or revision numbers or something to tie it all together to allow you to get a revision from a specific time makes your releases more repeatable, and makes it easier for you to do things like track down defects on a specific build in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaking of Continuous Delivery...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;There was a lot of good stuff at GOTO around this.&amp;nbsp; Dave&#39;s book was referenced on more than one occasion.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because that&#39;s a conference with quite a heavy lean towards agile, but it seems that getting stuff predictably and regularly into production, and not just being able to compile it and run the tests, is becoming not just an acceptable thing for teams to strive for, but a desirable one.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s definitely not an easy journey.&amp;nbsp; But it gives you all the great agile benefits like: fast feedback (from regular releases); decreased waste/inventory (as code is deployed to production as quickly as possible); decreased risk from both of the above things.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;On top of that, it could be argued that by striving for continuous delivery you&#39;re driving your design in a nice direction: modularisation, reduced coupling (e.g. if you want to make it possible to deploy individual components), separation of concerns (e.g. feature switches forces you to not have functionality tangled up in your code).&amp;nbsp; And then there are advantages to the organisation, as in order to create a smooth pipeline from the developer&#39;s machine to production, your developers will need to understand more about the environments the system is going to be running on, especially if they&#39;re writing/configuring tools to automate releasing.&amp;nbsp; They get particularly good at this if they&#39;re the ones getting the phone calls at evenings and weekends when the release goes wrong...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DevOps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;This moves nicely into the DevOps side of things.&amp;nbsp; It was particular interesting to hear Jeffrey Fredrick from TIM Group talk about the challenges they faced in moving from using managed hosting to an in-house infrastructure team.&amp;nbsp; It sounds like they&#39;ve faced very similar issues to those LMAXare working on right now, and I&#39;m very much looking forward to meeting up with Jeffrey back in London so we can exchange ideas.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s so rare to find anyone with very similar problems to you no matter what your technology or industry is, and it&#39;ll be dead interesting to swap stories.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think GOTO Copenhagen is the first conference where I spent all the time in sessions - I didn&#39;t have gaps in the schedule, and on the whole I got something from all the sessions I went to.&amp;nbsp; I often feel like I won&#39;t have much to take back to work with me when I see new technologies that we don&#39;t need to use or people espousing TDD and pair programming, but these sessions, and the keynotes, all gave me something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Other themes I haven&#39;t really mentioned were the same sorts of things I heard at &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt; - e.g. there&#39;s always more than one way to do something, and sometimes it&#39;s enough to be simply Good Enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;GOTO was a relatively intimate conference, with a limited number of attendees and relatively small rooms, so it felt easy to talk to new people and by the end of three days I saw familiar faces to smile at wherever I looked.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to Amsterdam now, although my brain is already full and I&#39;m not sure how much more I can fit in there!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://careers.grad-dc.co.uk/2012/05/18/107/&#34;&gt;yet another interview&lt;/a&gt; with me is available, but this one is in written form.  It&amp;rsquo;s for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it.  The site has a number of interviews with people in different roles so it&amp;rsquo;s quite a good way to showcase the diversity of what&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I was flattered to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-disruptor&#34;&gt;interviewed for InfoQ&lt;/a&gt; at QCon London. It was a fun interview actually,
and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything like the half an hour it actually took. In it, I get to talk about Agile at LMAX, the Disruptor (of course) and diversity in IT (again).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Update on events</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/update_on_events/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 12 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/update_on_events/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say I was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.star107.co.uk/podcasts/the-app-show/show-13-podcast.mp3&#34;&gt;interviewed for another podcast&lt;/a&gt;, again to talk about all-female events.  It&amp;rsquo;s only a short one and there&amp;rsquo;s probably not much in there that I haven&amp;rsquo;t said before, either on here or in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the 21st May, I&amp;rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp;amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.  If you see me there, come and say hello!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday 25th May, after all the GOTO craziness, I&amp;rsquo;m going to repeat the Disruptor presentation in Rotterdam at &lt;a href=&#34;http://010dev.nl/&#34;&gt;010DEV&lt;/a&gt;, an event rather fantastically called &amp;ldquo;The Disruptor and the Perfect Programmer&amp;rdquo;, which someone on Twitter correct noted sounds like a fairy tale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all that, I&amp;rsquo;m hopefully going to take June off to play Diablo 3 and Prototype 2, and read the next Game of Thrones book.  All these joys I have been denying myself to make sure I get everything sorted in time for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/outriders/2012/05/hello_outriders_this_week_for.shtml&#34;&gt;BBC Outriders podcast&lt;/a&gt; features yours truly venting about The Subject That Won&amp;rsquo;t Go Away, Women in Technology.  I was interviewed at Sunday&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/in-which-i-defend-male-species-at-all.html&#34;&gt;Girl Geek conference&lt;/a&gt;, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again.  For those who can&amp;rsquo;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In my opinion, now is a great time for women to make a name for themselves - conference organisers are crying out for you to attend and (if you want) speak, and our industry needs talented people of any type and isn&amp;rsquo;t that fussy about who you are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Please, please can we start talking about the good stuff that we see as women in IT?  We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t only talk about the issues we face.  Yes, we need to highlight problems and address them, but I believe that this message is drowning out all the great things about what we do, and why we love our jobs.  We should be encouraging people (not just women) to join us, not putting them off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had a very good time! &amp;nbsp;It was refreshing to meet new people, especially because they&#39;re mostly in different technology and business spaces. &amp;nbsp;I was really inspired to see the number of entrepreneurs, and people working for startups. &amp;nbsp;And I loved the range of ages, the diversity of people&#39;s backgrounds (ethnically, educationally, geographically...), and the fact that everyone bothered to come out on a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;rainy Sunday to learn stuff and meet people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did feel different to &#34;normal&#34; conferences. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;However&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I personally do not believe this was because it was an all-women event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/london-java-community-open-conference.html&#34;&gt;LJC Open Conference&lt;/a&gt; last year had a very different feel to JAX London and JavaOne - it was more intimate, easier to wing-it in presentations, friendlier. &amp;nbsp;You could chat to pretty much anyone over the coffee. You could smile at random people. &amp;nbsp;These are all the same things I felt about GGM today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t help but think this atmosphere of supportive learning and collaboration is at least partly a function of things like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5knk3-7_MGg/T52gXahpfRI/AAAAAAAAKKI/MNWVYBmKSkk/s1600/DSC_0027.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5knk3-7_MGg/T52gXahpfRI/AAAAAAAAKKI/MNWVYBmKSkk/s320/DSC_0027.jpg&#34; width=&#34;214&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;Size - smaller conferences are less intimidating, and you get to meet with people more than once, giving you the impression you&#39;re with friends rather than spectators.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venue - being seated (or even standing) around a table or in a coffee-break area is more intimate. &amp;nbsp;It means the speaker can make better eye contact, feels more engaged with the audience, and there&#39;s less of a barrier for active participation. &amp;nbsp;If the presenter is less than 3 metres from you, it&#39;s much easier to ask a question. &amp;nbsp;This leads to a chattier, more tailored session - more of a dialogue than a speech. &amp;nbsp;As a speaker I really prefer these sessions, and I think as an attendee I get more out of this too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common Goal - when you give up a day in your weekend to do &#34;work&#34; stuff, you have to have a clear idea of why you&#39;re doing it and what you&#39;re getting out of it. &amp;nbsp;I would say (although I could be wrong) that our common goal was to network, with a side-effect of learning &#34;stuff&#34;. &amp;nbsp;Events at the weekend are really only something you do for yourself, since you&#39;re not being paid for it. &amp;nbsp;That gives you common ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wanted to get a feel for if these awesome women were only going to events like these, and weren&#39;t going to &#34;normal&#34; conferences. &amp;nbsp;I think it was a mix. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t think (and I could be wrong) that people were coming to this &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; there were no guys. &amp;nbsp;I think they were coming because &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; were invited. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Someone mentioned that a conference organiser once told them they have to ask a man to speak at their conference at most two times. &amp;nbsp;They have to ask a woman up to seven times, to overcome their concerns and reassure them that they really do want them. &amp;nbsp;I wonder if women also need to be asked several times simply to attend conferences? &amp;nbsp;This would make a lot of sense - about 15-20% of the technical workforce are women, but around 5% of conference attendees are women. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s possibly that by the time women have been invited to, or told about, a conference enough times to make them want to go, it&#39;s totally sold out. &amp;nbsp;Do we need to very explicitly&amp;nbsp;invite women to our events? &amp;nbsp;Show them we really want them? &amp;nbsp;Multiple times? &amp;nbsp;And this is just for attendees, not even speakers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ll come back to some of this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pkwtZMrZs04/T52gPEVqtuI/AAAAAAAAKJY/Xp3q_1DtSNE/s1600/DSC_0003.jpg&#34;

cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rJmojN4eWHo/T52gT9XFdyI/AAAAAAAAKJw/kKmQTfyXWAo/s1600/DSC_0016.jpg&#34;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 13px; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Oh my goodness, all these women!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;In which I get to say that I think it&#39;s grossly unfair we do not allow men to this event. &amp;nbsp;In which I state that this behaviour is sexist and (in my mind) unhelpful. &amp;nbsp;But in which I also am told that women are still either a) experiencing alienation/sexist behaviour at conferences (thankfully it seemed like a limited amount) or b) feel like there are issues around boys club, macho posturing males, and thought if they presented at a conference they might get questions designed specifically to make them feel stupid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this is a very important point - even if none of this is happening, even if these women have never experienced this themselves, they think it &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be happening. &amp;nbsp;Also, please note, these issues do not affect just women. &amp;nbsp;These perceived problems are stopping less confident men from attending or speaking at these events.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What can be done about these things? &amp;nbsp;My answer is, it&#39;s up to &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The women, the less confident, the non-posturing non-alpha males, to make the changes we want to see. &amp;nbsp;And I can&#39;t claim all the glory for that answer. &amp;nbsp;When, during my very short stay at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt;, I complained to &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; that GOTO 2011 was full of white, male speakers, he said to me, why don&#39;t &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;speak then? &amp;nbsp;Of course I said &#34;who, me??&#34;. &amp;nbsp;I didn&#39;t think I had anything to talk about. &amp;nbsp;After attending a few conferences I realised that doesn&#39;t stop people. &amp;nbsp;And I realised people have to start somewhere. &amp;nbsp;And you have to start by doing some poor presentations to practice - you can&#39;t instantly be awesome. &amp;nbsp;It takes time, and practice, and Barrack Obama didn&#39;t come out of the womb knowing how to make an impact during a speech. &amp;nbsp;And guess what? &amp;nbsp;This year I&#39;m speaking at GOTO Copenhagen and Amsterdam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So my answer is, you want something? &amp;nbsp;Ask for it. &amp;nbsp;You want more women presenters? &amp;nbsp;Volunteer. &amp;nbsp;That panel is full of men? &amp;nbsp;Find out who organised it and what you need to do to be on it next year. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s down to &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Not to the conference organisers. &amp;nbsp;Not to some great beneficent &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt;. The responsibility is ours. &amp;nbsp;But it&#39;s better than that - the control is ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only you know what it is you want. &amp;nbsp;Only you can speak for you. &amp;nbsp;Not for all women; not for all white/black/purple people; not for all straight/gay/ambivalent folks; not for all geeks. &amp;nbsp;The question isn&#39;t &#34;What do women want?&#34; but &#34;What do &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; want?&#34;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think I saw some lightbulbs go off in the audience. &amp;nbsp;I hope so. &amp;nbsp;These women were all awesome, they have a lot to share with the world. &amp;nbsp;We all do, even the tiniest experience, the smallest thing we&#39;ve learnt is something someone else might not know yet. &amp;nbsp;Let&#39;s get out there and share it.&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Overheard: Agile truths</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/overheard_agile_truths/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;After attending a number of conferences and events, and performing numerous interviews, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to hear the same things again and again.  Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/tastapod&#34;&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentation/Decisions,%20decisions&#34;&gt;challenged all my assumptions at QCon&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to outright ridicule them, but I will put forward my personal opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: these are things I have heard from multiple sources, so with any luck I am not breaking the sanctity of the &lt;strike&gt;confessional&lt;/strike&gt; interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never pair programmed, but I&amp;rsquo;ve frequently worked with a partner on critical production problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this fascinating.  If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that needs to be fixed as fast, as correctly, as efficiently as possible, it&amp;rsquo;s a production issue.  And when there is one, &amp;ldquo;everyone&amp;rdquo; knows that two heads are better than one, even The Business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is the case, why is it so hard to sell pair programming as the default state of affairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it because creating new features is seen as just typing, where the bottleneck is access to the physical keyboard?  Is it because fixing defects when the pressure &lt;i&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; on is suddenly easier for one person on their own without help?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This state of affairs is interesting to me as it implies that when proverbial hits the fan, the instinctive thing to do is to work collaboratively.  Why don&amp;rsquo;t we do it more often?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;We use Test Driven Development to get coverage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems weird to me to write your tests first to get coverage.  If unit test coverage is your most important metric (and &lt;a href=&#34;http://craftedsw.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/code-coverage-is-side-effect-and-not.html&#34;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodenoughsoftware.net/2012/03/21/code-coverage/&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html&#34;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; covered why this might not be the case), I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why you would write your tests first.  Seems to me that you&amp;rsquo;d get better coverage writing the tests &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the code.  That way you can be sure you&amp;rsquo;ve covered every eventuality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the statement implies two assumptions which I would challenge:&lt;br /&gt;a) The primary value of writing your tests first is to meet your coverage requirements&lt;br /&gt;b) Coverage is a meaningful metric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TDD/BDD has a number of benefits (&amp;hellip;and now I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to list them here in case people repeat them back to me in an interview).  Good coverage will probably be a side effect of being forced to write your tests first, but I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced that&amp;rsquo;s the best thing that will come out of using TDD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I only test first when I know what I want to code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve overheard people saying that they test first when they know what the code is going to look like.  So you dive straight into the code when you &lt;i&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is a place for this - spikes, prototyping, getting a feel for a new library, so on and so forth.  But I feel that for most code that you write in your day job, you probably have a business requirement and possibly (probably?) a less firm idea of how you&amp;rsquo;re going to code it.  To me, this translates into writing the test first (which documents what you want to deliver, which you already know) and then getting that to pass (which is writing the code, which is the bit you might not know). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know exactly what the code is going to look like a) I would question that statement and b) what&amp;rsquo;s the point of the test?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the real answers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/qcon-london-2012.html&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt; I saw on Twitter a number of complaints because the presentations there gave opinions, guidelines, and, worst of all, a lot of &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.  But people seemed to want The Answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, what developers get paid for is working out the &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo; parameters and selecting an approach, technical or process-wise, that works for their situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So although I have strong opinions on all the above subjects, and although LMAX has specific approaches to both pair programming and automated testing, sadly I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into lots of details about those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m still interviewing candidates, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give away the correct answers&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m late with my write-up of &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;, and what&amp;rsquo;s worse, it will be partial - &amp;ldquo;sadly&amp;rdquo; I was in Lanzarote on a training week with the running club from the Thursday (8th) so I missed most of it.  A sacrifice I had to make for 7 days in the sunshine….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firstly, me me me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I presented the talk I &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/new-disruptor-presentation-unveiled-to.html&#34;&gt;previewed at Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt; the previous week, something I was calling the User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor, but actually turned out to be how-can-Trish-fill-95-slides-with-pictures-and-finish-in-under-40-minutes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The audience was different to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/&#34;&gt;Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt; event, not surprisingly.  What was surprising is that I expected people at the conference to be less aware of &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, and those who came to the Disruptor-only LJC event to have had more exposure to it.  It was a (pleasant) surprise to see how many of the standing-room-only audience had not only heard of the Disruptor but had &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;read stuff about it&lt;/a&gt; (I always love it when people have read my blog), played with it and were even using it in anger.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Because of that, I think if anything the talk did not go into enough detail, or enough new stuff, to please everyone.  Tough crowd!  But it was gratifying to hear the audience correct me in some of my answers, and answer other people&amp;rsquo;s questions - it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to know people are listening.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Of course, I will post a link to the presentation when it&amp;rsquo;s available.  For now only the &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/TrishaGee_ConcurrentProgrammingUsingTheDisruptor.pdf&#34;&gt;slides are online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I enjoyed QCon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;QCon was noticeably different to the other conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the last six months.  For one, it&amp;rsquo;s not a Java conference - sure, I was hosted on the Java track, but QCon is wider-ranging than just one technology platform.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s because of this, or because it was based in the notoriously impatient London, but I felt like there was a message of &amp;ldquo;Look, let&amp;rsquo;s just get stuff done, OK?&amp;rdquo;.  Ultimately we get paid to deliver stuff for the business, and since my favourite question is always &amp;ldquo;but what are we trying to achieve?&amp;rdquo; I like to hear ideas around how to actually deliver.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;ve loved the technology conferences - I like to hear about new stuff I had no idea about, and I really like the community vibe from them.  But it&amp;rsquo;s a nice change to be shaken up into thinking exactly &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; we do all this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Data Panorama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Firstly, Rebecca Parsons and &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt; from my old employer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; put Big Data into perspective.  Previously I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really cared about it - we process lots of data at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; but we don&amp;rsquo;t really have to dig into it, so Big Data is not top of my &amp;ldquo;oooh I really worry about that&amp;rdquo; problems.  There were quite a few interesting points I took out of this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6XxOlBvbMg/T3F3oFTMPFI/AAAAAAAAJlk/1uaS3_A3ozs/s1600/2012-03-07+09.58.29.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A6XxOlBvbMg/T3F3oFTMPFI/AAAAAAAAJlk/1uaS3_A3ozs/s320/2012-03-07+09.58.29.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - In the past, it was easy (and possibly even correct) to model the whole application based on the data you were collecting or manipulating (and probably storing in a relational database).  These days it&amp;rsquo;s not just the data from your app you need to worry about (and that can get big enough), but also all the news, blogs, twitter, and Facebook stuff generated by you and about you.  In addition, your data might not even be located with your app - the cloud has made the physical question of location redundant.  All of this pushes you towards an architecture which has to separate data from the application, and forces you to ponder your design.  I heard good arguments for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00794TAUG/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00794TAUG&#34;&gt;Domain Driven Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00794TAUG&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; here, which is nice because we like that at LMAX.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - Reporting and analytics on Big Data must be more fluid.  There&amp;rsquo;s so much data about you, your users, your application, out there that you don&amp;rsquo;t even know the questions to ask.  Instead you want to be able to spot patterns in data you didn&amp;rsquo;t even know you had,  I thought this was dead interesting - I studied Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at university, and we were told data mining using AI was going to be fundamental to companies who wanted to be on the bleeding edge.  Only now is it looking like people realise it&amp;rsquo;s becoming that important.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - Martin referred to Data Scientists and said he was suspicious of scientists.  I&amp;rsquo;d been reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139XTG4/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00139XTG4&#34;&gt;The Black Swan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B00139XTG4&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; on the train in that morning and couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if he&amp;rsquo;s read the same thing - that was talking about how you should treat someone with suspicion if they suggest you can apply science and logic to anything that is… well, actually to anything other than actual science (by which he meant physics I believe).  By saying it&amp;rsquo;s a science you suggest it&amp;rsquo;s predictable and follows rules.  And if it was predictable, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard.  Big Data is anything other than predictable - the data could be corrupt (it&amp;rsquo;s safest to assume some of it is); it&amp;rsquo;s generated by people (and we all know how fickle they are); and if you&amp;rsquo;re collecting lots of it practically randomly, then cause/effect/correlation are not guaranteed.  So Martin suggests the term Data Journalist.  There was a storm on Twitter which suggested a certain amount of disagreement with this term, but I like it.  But then, I like to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m a writer and not a programmer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - They gave some examples of using data to drive economic growth (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://opendata.go.ke/&#34;&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;) - what I thought was interesting about this is that it was a win-win situation - expose the data to grow technology skills, but get a lot of interesting/useful/socially responsible applications in return.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - Something I liked was about the idea of embracing &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; data, stuff that&amp;rsquo;s not trustworthy for whatever reason.  You can assume that the good data overwhelms the bad but you can&amp;rsquo;t be sure.  By looking for more fluffy patterns, vague correlations, in your data, you might expose something interesting even if the data&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo;.  As humans, we can&amp;rsquo;t expect that we won&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake - it&amp;rsquo;s better assume we will and work out how to deal with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - There was a call to not passively accept requirements, but to play an active role.  I like to think this ties in to my post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/why-customer-isnt-always-right.html&#34;&gt;working with your customer&lt;/a&gt;.  But then I would.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - I got a lot from this keynote, even if it was just a feeling of &amp;ldquo;I knew it!  I was right!&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highly available systems in Erlang&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Joe Armstrong was a very interesting person to listen to, clearly someone who&amp;rsquo;s been there and done that. Even without the presentation, &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/dl/qcon-london-2012/slides/JoeArmstrong_BuildingHighlyAvailableSystemsInErlang.pdf&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt; are interesting in their own right as they contain a lot of information and guidelines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;The points I took away are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - If part of the system fails, it&amp;rsquo;s not up to that part to fix itself.  You need special help to deal with failures.  If you fell over with a heart attack, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t try and heal yourself, you&amp;rsquo;d get a medic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - Isolation between threads/programs will mean that those different things cannot interfere with each other (i.e. no shared state).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - My favourite quote was &amp;ldquo;If you make things synchronous you&amp;rsquo;ll bugger things up&amp;rdquo;.  In theory, it&amp;rsquo;s so much easier for us humans (programmers) to think synchronously.  But whenever you design your system to by asynchronous, you find that your system actually becomes simpler and not more complicated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;JVM performance optimizations at Twitter&amp;rsquo;s scale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - I had a terrible view in the fully packed room, so I was just picking up phrases. I heard &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/asz&#34;&gt;Attila&lt;/a&gt; mention the Uncanny Valley, a phenomenon I was introduced to by my sister when she was studying her Cybernetics PhD (Google it, I found it fascinating).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt; - There was a lot of really useful information about how the Java GC works.  It seemed to back up the (rough) premise we work on - stuff that&amp;rsquo;s very short-lived is fine, and stuff that lasts &amp;ldquo;forever&amp;rdquo; is fine - it&amp;rsquo;s the stuff in between which  cripples your system when it keeps getting shoved around.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decisions Decisions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://dannorth.net/&#34;&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt; was, as always, an excellent speaker.  He entertained us but got us all thinking.  Five years ago at QCon London (my very first conference ever, and the thing that motivated me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/qcon-london.html&#34;&gt;start a professional blog&lt;/a&gt;), I saw Dan speaking and I was inspired to think about my working practices.  He was talking about BDD at the time, which was a relatively new concept to me.  I came away from that QCon with clearer ideas of what awesome development practices should look like.  Never did I imagine that five years later, not only would I be working in an environment which follows a lot of those practices (and pioneers many more) but that I would actually be speaking at the same conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSflRhQmCtU/T3F3eta5bUI/AAAAAAAAJlU/TSJDG-V23Ck/s1600/2012-03-07+16.47.15.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dSflRhQmCtU/T3F3eta5bUI/AAAAAAAAJlU/TSJDG-V23Ck/s320/2012-03-07+16.47.15.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since then, and of course, Dan isn&amp;rsquo;t talking about the same things either.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been to a lot of conferences this year, and I heard nothing really preaching to the &amp;ldquo;meta-agile&amp;rdquo; LMAX (still have a post pending about our agile practices&amp;hellip;).  When it comes to agile, there seem to be very few people who we can learn off - don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, there are lots of things we want to improve on, which is why we&amp;rsquo;re looking for people to learn off.  But most people are still preaching TDD and we want to know &amp;ldquo;what next?&amp;rdquo;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well, Dan took everything we thought we knew, and ripped it to pieces.  Taught us to challenge everything we think we know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;It was irritating actually because he had no answers.  But he did tell us that the answers we think we already have might not be the right ones….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;Well worth watching his talk when it comes online, I really can&amp;rsquo;t summarise it here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developers Have a Mental Disorder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I nearly missed this ending keynote.  I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t, Greg Young is awesome at ranting.  He said developers have a disease - we overcomplicate things, when we try to simplify things.  We want to abstract stuff, we love to look for patterns and reuse when actually sometimes we just need to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my notes I have &amp;ldquo;People come to conferences for answers, when they should be remembering to use their brains&amp;rdquo;.  I assume that&amp;rsquo;s a quote from him, and not a comment I thought of at the time, but I wholeheartedly agree with it - if a shiny new technology solved your problems, you&amp;rsquo;d be out of a job.  Your job is to take the problem and figure out how to solve it.  Not to drag and drop an answer into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another talk that I can&amp;rsquo;t do justice to, watch the video when it comes online.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;…and finally….&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;At the end of the day, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atlassian.com/&#34;&gt;Atlassian&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored community night was awesome.  I got to chat to (be prepared for gratuitous name dropping here) &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;; my old friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simonbrown.je/&#34;&gt;Simon Brown&lt;/a&gt;; my ubiquitous &lt;a href=&#34;http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/karianna&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;

width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want to solve the problem your business has, you might want to model your system around their world.  Funny, that sounds suspiciously like Domain Driven Design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Synchronous is bad, mmmkay? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardcore understanding of what the computer is really doing seems to be coming back into fashion.  Hmmm, I wonder who started that…? (tongue firmly in cheek, we can&amp;rsquo;t have been the only ones)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;rsquo;t tune something you don&amp;rsquo;t understand&amp;rdquo; - testing and monitoring is kinda important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our business is all about trade offs.  There is no perfect solution, they pay us because it&amp;rsquo;s very very hard to work out something that&amp;rsquo;s Good Enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultimately it feels like back to basics: understand the problem; model the domain, and have sympathy for the hardware that&amp;rsquo;s running your solution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Corporate Bit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;QCon overall turned out to be a bit of an LMAX fest in the end, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://bad-concurrency.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Andy Stewart (our Chief Lord Business Analyst), all giving presentations there as well as me.  It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be on home turf, and it&amp;rsquo;s very cool to see that we have such a range of things to talk about that so many of us are invited to speak.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p2&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;I just found out there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconnewyork.com/&#34;&gt;QCon in New York&lt;/a&gt;.  My invitation seems to have got lost in the post.  Don&amp;rsquo;t suppose anyone wants me to speak there…?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20120304/?pg=56&amp;amp;pm=1&amp;amp;u1=friend&#34;&gt;month&amp;rsquo;s Java Magazine&lt;/a&gt; features an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor.  It&amp;rsquo;s basically a summary of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now.  If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is intended as part one of a series, as it&amp;rsquo;s a basic and high-level view with no code examples.  In fact, it probably could be used to document the C# version as well as the Java version, although I haven&amp;rsquo;t taken a look at that for a while.  Next, I would like to give some more code examples of how you use it - as always, any suggestions welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>New Disruptor Presentation Unveiled to the LJC!</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I presented my new &amp;ldquo;User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; talk to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;.  Since it was very kindly hosted at Skillsmatter, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/the-disruptor/js-3798&#34;&gt;video of the presentation&lt;/a&gt; available, and the slides are below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;width:425px&#34; id=&#34;__ss_12091737&#34;&gt; &lt;strong style=&#34;display:block;margin:12px 0 4px&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/a-users-guide-to-the-disruptor&#34; title=&#34;Concurrent Programming Using the Disruptor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Concurrent Programming Using the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/12091737&#34; width=&#34;425&#34; height=&#34;355&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div style=&#34;padding:5px 0 12px&#34;&gt; View more &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trisha Gee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presentation is a little different to the ones we&amp;rsquo;ve done before.  Previously we&amp;rsquo;ve gone into how it works and why it&amp;rsquo;s fast.  This time I wanted to step back a little from the internals and show how real developers might actually use it.  The example is somewhat contrived, but the idea is to give some hints on how to break your problem down into something that will work with a Disruptor at the heart of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the event went really well.  It was a tiny bit &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; intimidating, as there were no lightning talks and I was the only attraction.  Seeing over a hundred people turn up after work, before beer, to hear you talk is a humbling experience.  Fortunately, I think the audience was perfect for the presentation - they had heard of the Disruptor but hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen anything very detailed about it, so my walkthrough of how you might use it seemed to go down well.  I certainly got a lot of very sensible questions (which hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve remembered to repeat for the benefit of the recording), and people had some good ideas about how and when to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran the same presentation to a different audience at QCon London a week later, I&amp;rsquo;ll post a link to that if/when it becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why the customer isn&#39;t always right</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_the_customer_isnt_always_right/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to get my hair cut (yes, sorry, this is a story about hair).  I had thought long and hard about what I wanted.  I researched, checked styles online, and bought a magazine so I could show my hairdresser exactly what I was after and there would be no confusion.  I was determined I would not be spending that ridiculous amount of money on something I was not going to be happy with.  I was even bold enough to ask for some changes to it at the end, which I have never ever had the courage to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did an excellent job.  It was almost exactly what I had asked for, with some variations to account for my particular hair type.  It was a very cute hair style that suited me.  But I had a niggling doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, that niggle was a certainty.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it was what I had asked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being English, the thought of going back and telling him I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with it was horrifying.  Especially since he had done a really good job of it.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t his fault that what I&amp;rsquo;d asked for wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I had actually wanted.  But I knew what I wanted now, and I was prepared to pay for it (again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I didn&amp;rsquo;t show him a picture.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t point to anything specific.  I said I wanted it much shorter after all and outlined the look I was going for.  We had a conversation about it and I left it to him to apply his skills to actually implement it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I was much happier with the results.  In fact, it was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this got me thinking about work.  It&amp;rsquo;s not just a lame excuse to write about girl stuff on a supposedly technical blog.  It got me thinking about our customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever our customers are, whether they&amp;rsquo;re end users, internal business owners, external clients, or we work in a bank and have fifteen thousand layers of Business Analysts between us and Real People, whoever they are they want something from us.  And in many places, we, the techies, have trained them to ask for more and more specific things, so they can be sure they&amp;rsquo;re going to get what they really want.  Remember that time Bob asked for that extra field on that report because it would make his job easier?  Remember when Sandra wanted the workflow to be altered in a specific way?  It&amp;rsquo;s because they know that if they ask for something specific, the chances are better that it will make its way to the front of the work queue at some point, and when it comes out the other end it is more likely to be what they wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only it isn&amp;rsquo;t, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always another field to add, or another change to make.  And your customer isn&amp;rsquo;t quite satisfied, even though you did exactly what they asked for.  And sometimes they don&amp;rsquo;t tell you that they&amp;rsquo;re not getting what they need from your system, because it&amp;rsquo;s expensive or time consuming to get changes made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to delivering something they really want, instead of something else that&amp;rsquo;s merely adding to the weight of your code, is finding out what they&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Bob wants that extra field.  That&amp;rsquo;s easy enough.  But when you ask him why he wants that extra field, turns out it&amp;rsquo;s because the numbers in the reports he&amp;rsquo;s getting at the moment aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones he needs, or aren&amp;rsquo;t quite correct.  He&amp;rsquo;s probably created a monstrous Excel spreadsheet into which he manually types half of the numbers from the reports it took you ages to develop, which munges them into something quite different, in order to get the real thing he wants.  He&amp;rsquo;s just missing this one small piece of information to get the final figure correct.  It would save your company a lot of time/money/mis-typing errors if you completely re-wrote the reports Bob uses to give him exactly what he needs.  Or if you gave him a tool to download CSV formatted raw data from the database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not Bob&amp;rsquo;s fault he can&amp;rsquo;t ask for this, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what we&amp;rsquo;re capable of providing him.  It&amp;rsquo;s not our fault for not delivering it the first time round, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what he does day-to-day.  But having a conversation where we recognise where the knowledge lies (Bob knows what the output of his day job is presumably, and we know what&amp;rsquo;s available and how we can provide it), and collaborating to come up with the least rubbish solution for everyone, is a step to providing that overused term, &amp;ldquo;business value&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not on different sides here, we all play for the same team - we want our jobs to be as painless as possible, which (should) ultimately provide better efficiency for our company.  After all, we want the company to make money so they can pay us, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;Caveat: Mileage may vary.  Sometimes, with some customers, you really do need to tell them what they want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Upcoming speaking events</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_speaking_events/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/upcoming_speaking_events/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;In theory, I am busy writing material for my upcoming speaking events, rather than writing terribly &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/12/christmas-decorations-teach-me-lesson.html&#34;&gt;illuminating&lt;/a&gt; posts on my blog (see what I did there?).  In actuality I am being lazy and have pretty much taken January off for a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the spirit of doing something which ticks both the event-speaking and blogging boxes, this is a quick update on the conferences I&amp;rsquo;m confirmed for so far.  Put the following dates in your diary - these are my first international solo speaking events:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7th March - QCon London - &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/speaker/Trisha+Gee&#34;&gt;Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; (sadly I can&amp;rsquo;t stay for the whole conference as it clashes with the only holiday I had booked for 2012).&lt;br /&gt;23rd May - GOTO Copenhagen - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/cph-2012/speaker/Trisha+Gee&#34;&gt;Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; War Stories.&lt;br /&gt;25-26th May - GOTO Amsterdam - &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2012/speaker/Trisha+Gee&#34;&gt;Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The presentation will be more of a user&amp;rsquo;s guide to the Disruptor than anything we&amp;rsquo;ve done before.  An hour isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of time to cover all the functionality everyone might want to see, so I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to work out the balance between giving an introduction/overview for those who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before, and going into some of the cool features that have been added since I first started blogging about it.  If there&amp;rsquo;s anything you would particularly like to see covered, let me know - I&amp;rsquo;ll put the most frequently requested things in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I&amp;rsquo;d run a workshop session at some point, but that will require quite a lot more preparation, so I&amp;rsquo;ll only do that if there is interest in it (if someone wants to fly me somewhere interesting to do that so much the better!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll see you at one of these events?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;And now, after an absence of several weeks, you get to see how long it takes me to write some of these posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_IL9JCpG-YI/TxUujcWyp3I/AAAAAAAAIvg/uMQCtOKGPcs/s1600/DSC_0037.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_IL9JCpG-YI/TxUujcWyp3I/AAAAAAAAIvg/uMQCtOKGPcs/s400/DSC_0037.JPG&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was putting up the Christmas decorations one Saturday when my worst fear was realised&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - one of my three strings of lights was not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two went up fine.  The third lit up when I plugged it in, and in less than a second went out.  Curses.  This is not what I wanted, this was supposed to be a short exercise in making my tiny little flat look festive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I set about the tedious task of starting from the end closest to the plug and replacing every bulb, one by one, with a spare one to see if it magically lit up again.  When it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, you take the spare back out and replace it with the original bulb.  I remember my parents going through this ritual every Christmas, the tediousness of this activity is more memorable than the fleeting joy of shinies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was doing this, my mind was back on the job I&amp;rsquo;d been doing at work the previous week - battling an Internet Explorer 7 performance problem.  We have automated performance tests which give us an indication of the load time for our application in Chrome and IE, and some time in the previous couple of weeks our IE performance had significantly degraded in the development code.  Due to a number of too-boring-to-explain-here circumstances, the last known good revision was four days and nearly 250 revisions earlier than the first revision that showed the performance problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything to indicate it was an environmental problem, the logical next step was to pinpoint the revision which caused the problem, so we could either fix it or get performance gains from somewhere else in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gnC5YOnp9-8/TxUy6Y0I72I/AAAAAAAAIvo/bDlg30_CMvA/s1600/revisions1.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious way to do this, given there were no obvious suspects, is with a binary search of the revisions.  Our last known good revision was 081, our first poor performing one was 240.  So the thing to do is to check revision 160, see if it falls on the poor or good performance side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NyxMETVmxrM/TxUy6uuKWuI/AAAAAAAAIvs/HG9HdBMMZfE/s1600/revisions2.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;if 160 is fine, test revision 200&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a4pDFa23AS8/TxUy8AZZL6I/AAAAAAAAIv8/YGX5b314ZPA/s1600/revisions4.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;88&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a4pDFa23AS8/TxUy8AZZL6I/AAAAAAAAIv8/YGX5b314ZPA/s320/revisions4.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;and keep splitting the revisions by half until you find the suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course that&amp;rsquo;s what I want to do with my stupid Christmas lights.  I do not want to sequentially check each light bulb, that has a worst-case number-of-bulbs-tried = n, where n is the number of bulbs (probably a couple of hundred, although it felt like several thousand).  So, in computer speak, O(n).  The binary search algorithm is O(log n).  At university, this Big Oh had no context for me.  But when you&amp;rsquo;ve taken 10 minutes to get a quarter of the way through your Christmas lights, and you diagnosed your IE performance problems&amp;hellip; well, actually it took days.  But the point is, a binary search for the missing bulb would definitely have been a Good Thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&amp;rsquo;re dying to know if I tracked down the problem in Internet Explorer - I did.  What&amp;rsquo;s the worst case when you&amp;rsquo;re doing a binary search?  It&amp;rsquo;s when the thing you&amp;rsquo;re looking for is veeeery close to either your start point or your end point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The revision number I was after was number 237.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TKU7fyVqnxs/TxUzePYv0eI/AAAAAAAAIwI/ewwyYBPE8no/s1600/revisions5.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;88&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TKU7fyVqnxs/TxUzePYv0eI/AAAAAAAAIwI/ewwyYBPE8no/s320/revisions5.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my Christmas tree lights?  Well, through the boredom I remembered that modern lights are in sections, so they have a sort of built-in binary search - well, limited segments will go dark if a single bulb is out - which allows you to narrow down your problem area.  Since the whole string was out, I figured something else was probably wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turned out the plug had come out of the socket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 1&lt;/b&gt;: Theoretical computer science does have a place when you care about how long something takes.  When it&amp;rsquo;s you feeling the pain, you&amp;rsquo;ll do anything to make it stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 2&lt;/b&gt;: When diagnosing a problem you will always biased towards what you think it is, in the face of actual evidence.  I was afraid I would have to search the whole set of lights for a blown bulb, so that&amp;rsquo;s the problem I was looking for when the lights failed.  In actual fact it was a problem with a much simpler solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; - OK, &amp;ldquo;worst fear&amp;rdquo; in this very limited context only - it&amp;rsquo;s not like I lie awake at night in July afraid that one of the bulbs on my Christmas lights has blown.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to make your CV Not Suck</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_to_make_your_cv_not_suck/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_to_make_your_cv_not_suck/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re applying for a job at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;, your CV (or résumé, for our American readers) usually comes through me and I decide whether
to call you for a technical phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you into a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you the criteria I use when judging your CV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you could say this is a foolish thing for me to do, because now when you apply you&amp;rsquo;ll be &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo; and writing your CV to pass
these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LMAX isn&amp;rsquo;t the only company that&amp;rsquo;s going to judge your CV based on these criteria. I firmly believe that an increase in quality of the
CVs in our industry can only be A Good Thing.  An increase in the quality of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; CV is definitely A Good Thing for
&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more importantly, if I get CVs that do not pass these basic criteria, now I know you either don&amp;rsquo;t read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX blogs&lt;/a&gt; (shame on
you), or you&amp;rsquo;re not able to follow simple instructions (bodes poorly for your ability to learn within the company).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that you have to keep in mind when you&amp;rsquo;re writing your CV is that the reader really does spend less than a minute reading it.
It&amp;rsquo;s not fair, true.  But it&amp;rsquo;s the way humans are. I&amp;rsquo;m not in HR or recruitment, I have a proper job as a software developer,
and I need to get back to that as soon as I can.  When I get CVs in batches of up to 12, as I regularly do,
I&amp;rsquo;m not free to spend more than 10 minutes going through all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-easy-stuff-&#34;&gt;The Easy Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-must-be-able-to-spell-&#34;&gt;You must be able to spell&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really must.  There are things called Spell Checkers and they are amazing.  Some of these new-fangled pieces of software even show
you your errors in this cool squiggly red underline in your document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading your CV in Open Office, and if I see red squigglies under words that aren&amp;rsquo;t technologies or acronyms I&amp;rsquo;m going to wonder how
good your attention to detail is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-must-use-capital-letters-in-the-appropriate-places&#34;&gt;You must use capital letters in the appropriate places###&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s traditional to start a sentence with a capital.  It&amp;rsquo;s also traditional to use a capital &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rdquo; when referring to oneself. We&amp;rsquo;re
not 14 years old, we&amp;rsquo;re not writing an SMS to our mates.  We&amp;rsquo;re applying for a proper job paying proper money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;correct-grammar-is-appreciated-&#34;&gt;Correct grammar is appreciated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a native English-speaker or not, you need to get someone else who is a native English-speaker to check the prose in your
CV to see if it scans correctly. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s not about being prejudiced against you because you&amp;rsquo;re not a natural author,
it&amp;rsquo;s a) attention to detail again and b) your ability to make yourself understood.  If your sentence construction,
choice of words or simple comma placement is off, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to read that sentence a couple of times to parse it and it&amp;rsquo;s going to trip
me up and ruin my flow.  I want to get a good feel for you from reading your CV, so if I stumble a few times I&amp;rsquo;m not going to feel like
I connected with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harder-and-fluffier-&#34;&gt;Harder and fluffier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-dont-care-which-versions-of-spring-youve-worked-with-&#34;&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t care which versions of Spring you&amp;rsquo;ve worked with&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you need a checklist of technologies on your CV so it gets past the non-technical recruitment agents and get picked up via
automated searches.  This is a bigger problem with our industry than one I want to tackle right now.  So I&amp;rsquo;ll let you off having
buzzword bingo on your CV.  However, your CV needs to be more than just a list of technologies you have used vaguely,
or perhaps once read about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s useful to me if a) you put the technology check list in a single place on your CV, b) you give an indication of your level of
proficiency in that technology (novice/competent/master) or length of time you&amp;rsquo;ve used it in a commercial environment,
and c) you organise them in some useful fashion - preferably the ones that are appropriate to the job you&amp;rsquo;re applying for near the top,
or at least those you&amp;rsquo;re happiest with at the top.  Alternatively put the checklist of technologies next to the role you used them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often I will completely ignore this section because I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in your ability to learn and your passion for what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-want-to-know-about-your-passions-&#34;&gt;I want to know about your passions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the old days I used to fast forward to your hobbies and interests, but these days we&amp;rsquo;re encouraged not to put those on the CV in case
you&amp;rsquo;re judged against them.  Which seems like political correctness gone crazy, but then when you think about it you can infer a lot
about a person from their hobbies and interests, and therefore you could be pre-judging them based on some criteria that is not at all
associated with their ability to do the job.  For example, if they have hobbies that take them all over England I might infer they have
a car and can drive - OK, it&amp;rsquo;s a dumb example, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, given that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find great team members to work with me at LMAX, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for things like: your blog; any
contributions to open source software; your involvement in a Java User Group (or other extra-curricular activity).  I&amp;rsquo;m not going to
discard you if you don&amp;rsquo;t have any of these things, but if you do it&amp;rsquo;s definitely extra brownie points for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-want-to-know-if-you-worship-at-the-altar-of-technology-or-if-youre-business-value-driven-&#34;&gt;I want to know if you worship at the altar of technology, or if you&amp;rsquo;re business-value driven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either of these things is fine - we need people who are very business-focussed and people who are rabid about technology,
as well as all those in between, to build a good team.  Another axis of interest is people/process - are you passionate about people,
about building a good team, about helping them to deliver?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a feel for where you sit on these axes is not for me to discard you, but if you look like you&amp;rsquo;re strongly in one of these camps
and I feel like we need a team member to really push that area, then you stand a much better chance of getting a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll get an indication of where you are by the way you talk about your roles and your achievements.  This does not help me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Developer on a web administration application.  Product was implemented using JavaScript, HTML, Spring, Hibernate, JMS, and MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much more useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of a team of four developers implementing a web based administration application, commissioned to enable internal users to
update the settings of our reporting tool.  This saved the support staff approximately 4 hours every week,
as they no longer needed to manually update the database. We used agile techniques such as daily standups and weekly iterations in order
to provide quick feedback to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I made both of those up, by the way, before anyone starts trying to sue me for stealing something off their CV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I can see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The size of the team, and your ability to work in a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You understood the business need you were trying to fulfill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have worked in an agile environment and at least pay lip service to why you were working that way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about the specific technologies you used, the fact that you mentioned web-based and database gives me enough of a
feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sometimes-prospective-employers-really-do-stalk-you-&#34;&gt;Sometimes prospective employers really do stalk you&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I think claims that prospective employers will check every facet of your web presence are somewhat over-exaggerated.  If I
barely have 60 seconds to read your CV, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to check you out on Facebook, my life is too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you claim to have written a book I will look it up on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you have a publication or example
code, I will glance at those.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for in the past, I&amp;rsquo;ll look you up on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://uk.linkedin.com/in/trishagee&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; to see if we have any common connections (or worse,
to see if I should remember you and simply don&amp;rsquo;t).  I&amp;rsquo;ll also use LinkedIn if your CV is not screaming yes or no,
to see if there&amp;rsquo;s an extra dimension in your profile which will tip me one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be aware of your web presence, particularly something that is aimed at your professional image like LinkedIn,
and make sure it represents you the way you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion-&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post might be simply a good way to increase my own workload - every CV I get from now on may be an automatic pass,
and then I have to call all of you before I can start weeding you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t mind too much about that.  I get concerned sometimes that good people are not getting the interviews they deserve,
not just at LMAX but across the industry, because they get almost no good CV advice.  Frequently the people who are the first to read
CVs are agencies who are not technologists.  By all means, have words on there that will make your CV appear on their search results.&lt;br&gt;
But you need to put something on there for me, a real developer, because strings of keywords tell me nothing about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can improve the quality of just one person&amp;rsquo;s CV with this post, I&amp;rsquo;m happy.  If I have given you that first step towards that job
you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want, then that&amp;rsquo;s even better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt; Mike and I presented &amp;ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&amp;rdquo;.
This is the session we &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/mike-and-i-debut-our-new-disruptor.html&#34;&gt;initially previewed&lt;/a&gt; to the
London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the
venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage,
which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/embed/DCdGlxBbKU4&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received some really great feedback on this presentation, and it was brilliant to see a lot of the speakers from JAX there watching us.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Tori Wieldt from the Oracle Technology Network interviewed me at Devoxx.  Because I was there to be on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/11/why-we-shouldnt-target-women.html&#34;&gt;Why We Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Target Women&lt;/a&gt; panel, the interview is just another platform for me to air my views on this subject again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;object height=&#34;395&#34; width=&#34;395&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;wmode&#34; value=&#34;direct&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#222222&#34;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;sv=true&amp;pageId=2769&#34; &gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/dist/share/parleysshare.swf&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; flashVars=&#34;sv=true&amp;pageId=2769&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#222222&#34; width=&#34;395&#34; height=&#34;395&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am actually wearing pink&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Saturday was, hopefully, my last conference of the year.  My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pY5RNaGdzKc/TtP9CtxtxzI/AAAAAAAAIu0/JTuUubrCF6g/s1600/DSC_0035.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pY5RNaGdzKc/TtP9CtxtxzI/AAAAAAAAIu0/JTuUubrCF6g/s320/DSC_0035.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Who wants to propose a session?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;In many ways the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; Open Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&amp;rsquo;s near home and I helped to organise it.  One of the awesome things about both &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/javaone-2011-roundup.html&#34;&gt;Java One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/11/devoxx-story-so-far.html&#34;&gt;Devoxx&lt;/a&gt; was the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.  The scale, and the opportunities to meet key players in the Java world, were the things I probably appreciated the most from both of those conferences.  And you can tell from my posts I really enjoyed them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the LJC conference was probably perfect as my last one for 2011:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W-M-FpMSB8o/TtP9R2P6uiI/AAAAAAAAIu8/ZXAGUEuhb7Y/s1600/DSC_0065.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W-M-FpMSB8o/TtP9R2P6uiI/AAAAAAAAIu8/ZXAGUEuhb7Y/s320/DSC_0065.jpg&#34; width=&#34;214&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;How do you spell &amp;lsquo;lightning&amp;rsquo;?&amp;ldquo;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Being on home turf with awesome people who have really helped drag me kicking and screaming into the conference scene really brought home to me what an amazing year this has been.  This time last year, I felt I barely had the credentials to be a behind-the-scenes organiser for the LJC, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t attend last year&amp;rsquo;s conference because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how much I would get out of it.  This year, I&amp;rsquo;m at the conference giving two sessions, having made my international début already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With 120 people you feel like you can talk to everyone at some point if you want to.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I managed that, but I probably chatted in one way or another with maybe half the attendees.  The great thing about this is you see the wide variety of things people are working on - the technologies, the business problems, the team and company sizes, the methodologies. It&amp;rsquo;s eye-opening and quite exciting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seemed that a small, open conference like this drives content based on relevance.  We had no vendor pitches, although John was contractually obliged to mention Atlassian at least once every half hour (but as they paid for the beer, this was only fair).  People vote with their feet, and attend the sessions that they will get the most out of.  I liked this format a lot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I presented alone for the first time, not hiding behind &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;.  I found this surprisingly liberating.  I love working with those guys, but without them providing a safety net I actually found my confidence increasing as I realised I was perfectly capable of answering things I would probably have let them field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My second session was more workshop-like, and I wanted the audience to guide what we covered.  I thought it went really well, I loved letting the audience guide it, and I enjoyed giving it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was honoured (and terrified) to be asked to be part of a Meet the Experts panel with people who actually know what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about.  I was very very pleased to get away with not being asked any questions about being a girl or the length of my skirt.  We had a great discussion around writing high performance code, about different technologies and their applicability, and about the future of Java and JVM-based languages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I loved the venue.  The rooms were a nice range of sizes, all with projectors of course, but also whiteboard space and flip charts.  It looked like a 1960s version of the future - all shiny white surfaces and curving lines.  But it felt like a space to create and innovate in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mike&amp;rsquo;s Hacking the Open JDK session in the morning was excellent.  Again, this was another example of a workshop format working really well.  He gave some good background to compilers in general, and a good walk through of some of the code that&amp;rsquo;s there at the moment.  He was happy to share stuff he&amp;rsquo;d learnt the hard way, and it made me want to get more involved in that side of things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The food was &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T2mIA_BATOs/TtP-H7zXG0I/AAAAAAAAIvE/zpPILN-XR1A/s1600/DSC_0054.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T2mIA_BATOs/TtP-H7zXG0I/AAAAAAAAIvE/zpPILN-XR1A/s320/DSC_0054.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Clearly people haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough coffee yet.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;My sessions were User&amp;rsquo;s Guides to the Disruptor - a beginner&amp;rsquo;s and a more advanced one.  The beginner&amp;rsquo;s was an updated summary of the Disruptor stuff already covered in this blog - the ring buffer, writing to and reading from it, and configuration.  The second session covered  more advanced ideas: you don&amp;rsquo;t need a ring buffer any more; cache lines and false sharing; worker pools; aggregate event handlers. This session was a lot less prepared and more collaborative, and I loved giving it.  Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s my teacher-genetics coming out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The aim of both sessions was to give people an idea of how to actually use the Disruptor - developers are definitely interested in how and why it works, but we&amp;rsquo;ve been evangelising a lot and now there are very sensible questions being asked about how to get it to do various things.  I&amp;rsquo;d like to run some more of these sessions in future, and to add more material to the blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6Fzn_ybxqys/TtP_H1sV-ZI/AAAAAAAAIvM/2Vx-NmjgLT4/s1600/DSC_0117.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6Fzn_ybxqys/TtP_H1sV-ZI/AAAAAAAAIvM/2Vx-NmjgLT4/s320/DSC_0117.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;And finally, a proper meal before more beer.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;Back to the conference.  Were there any downsides?  Personally I had none.  If I had to suggest an improvement for next year, it&amp;rsquo;s that we would like to see more novice speakers presenting.  The LJC has always been about nurturing this talent, and a small conference like this one with a friendly audience, many of whom you may already know, is a great place to practice.  The lightning talks showed the great variety (and abilities) of our members, it would be nice to expand this to full sessions.  As I found, filling a 30 minute session is not anywhere near as hard as you think!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to next year&amp;rsquo;s LJC conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m totally buzzing from the positive vibe from this year&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jrd5fzdD4Jg/TtP7_O_05CI/AAAAAAAAIus/nnx_gab0UEk/s1600/DSC_0096.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jrd5fzdD4Jg/TtP7_O_05CI/AAAAAAAAIus/nnx_gab0UEk/s400/DSC_0096.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;The LJC Associates modelling their lovely new t-shirts.  Mine fits!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back from Devoxx, having had lots of food for thought.  In particular, my panel on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Why+We+Shouldn%27t+Target+Women&#34;&gt;Why We Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Target Women&lt;/a&gt; generated a lot of discussion and I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to process it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRa9yncj_HA/TsdmXlW-JhI/AAAAAAAAIng/5UUHweA8pWE/s1600/DSC_0136.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eRa9yncj_HA/TsdmXlW-JhI/AAAAAAAAIng/5UUHweA8pWE/s640/DSC_0136.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Martijn Verburg; Regina ten Bruggencate; Trisha Gee; Antonio Goncalves; Claude Falguière; Kim Ross &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The panel went really well, we got decent interaction from the audience, and of course my fellow panel members were awesome.  I managed to restrain myself from using the opportunity as my own personal soap box and allowed other people to speak occasionally.  Sadly the only male on the panel stole the show somewhat, so Antonio won&amp;rsquo;t be invited in future&amp;hellip; Actually in seriousness, it was great to have a guy on the panel to present his point of view.  It was interesting that he&amp;rsquo;s a father, highlighting that parenting issues are not the same as women&amp;rsquo;s issues, and conflating those two concerns hurts both genders. But Antonio&amp;rsquo;s hair is far too shiny and pretty and he&amp;rsquo;s funnier than I am, so I&amp;rsquo;m not standing next to him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to make a note of all the issues discussed during the hour, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, I was too busy trying not to fall over in my girly six-inch stiletto boots to remember anything that happened.  The video will hopefully be available on Parleys some time in the future, so I will link to it when it&amp;rsquo;s there if it&amp;rsquo;s not too horribly embarrassing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34; cellpadding=&#34;0&#34; cellspacing=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;tr-caption-container&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xiMJbYyi8p8/Tsdmcsb99JI/AAAAAAAAIoQ/ycVvxgezN7A/s1600/DSC_0142.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;428&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xiMJbYyi8p8/Tsdmcsb99JI/AAAAAAAAIoQ/ycVvxgezN7A/s640/DSC_0142.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;tr-caption&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;Someone let me have the microphone again&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;One question that came up more than once throughout the week was: IT/programming is not the only industry with a lack of women, why should we care?  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just natural?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we need to be very careful before writing off such an imbalance as &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;.  We need to make sure first that we aren&amp;rsquo;t discriminating against groups, consciously or through some unnoticed system bias.    And for me, the thing is that we notice that women aren&amp;rsquo;t well represented in technical roles, but we don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily notice the other groups of people who might be being put off for similar (or maybe totally different) reasons.  We can&amp;rsquo;t so easily tell if gays, jews, parents, shy people, folks from poor backgrounds or any other less distinguishable sets of people are finding it hard to make it as a programmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can see the figures for females.  In the UK in 2008:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;44.7% of people taking ICT (Information and Communications Technology) at GCSE (age 14-16) are girls.  As in many other subjects these days, the girls get better results than the boys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;38.6% of kids taking ICT at A Level (16-18) are girls.  Only 9.6% of Computing students are girls. Again, girls outperform the boys in both subjects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19.4% of those studying Computer Science at university are women.  This is down from 24% in 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Through a not-very-scientific poll of the members of the London Java Community, it looks like approximately 15% of techies in industry are women.  Interestingly, some companies have a much higher proportion than others, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s something to explore another time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;The thing that worries me about these figures are a) the &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; hints at a drop-off in interest in the subject, not a lack of ability, since the girls are doing well tech subjects but choose not to pursue them and b) the numbers are declining in some areas, specifically university applications.  I&amp;rsquo;ve read studies that show the percentage of those in technical jobs who are women has been steadily declining since the 80s, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get specific figures, especially as I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in programming / technical roles rather than just the percentage of women &amp;ldquo;in IT&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the numbers are declining, that seems like a smell to me.  Not only do we have some sort of image problem which puts people like those who have two X chromosomes off from entering our industry, we&amp;rsquo;re driving them away when they get here.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that&amp;rsquo;s because women find they&amp;rsquo;re not good at it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other industries have been successful at attracting a higher proportion of women - for example, in 1950, only 15% of accountants were women.  By 1985 half of all accounting majors were women, and by 1990 the majority of the workforce was female.  It would be nice to think we could learn something from our friends in the Maths world.  After all, the skills are not dissimilar.  But they have a slight advantage over us - in many countries all children are required to study maths until age 16.  However, there are very few 16-year-olds who have any programming experience at all.  Either we need to accept that we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to hire kids with other degrees and train them to be programmers, or we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to do some serious outreach to interest kids in programming and technology long before they start to make their exam choices.  In the UK, they need to choose their GCSE subjects at 14, which means we probably need to be targeting kids as young as 10 or 11.  That&amp;rsquo;s not inconceivable, when you think about it - how many of us were programming in BASIC aged eight or nine?  Could we not teach kids to write an iPhone app or a Facebook app instead?  I was very pleased to hear someone in our audience was teaching their daughter to program.  At an even younger age, the least you can do is buy your kids Lego - I&amp;rsquo;m sure that exercises the right parts of the brain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The point is, that I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can conclude that it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; for girls to not be interested in programming.  The first programmer was a woman, and during the war and even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stanford.edu/group/gender/cgi-bin/wordpressblog/2011/06/researcher-reveals-how-computer-geeks-replaced-computer-girls/&#34;&gt;into the &amp;rsquo;60s many programmers were women&lt;/a&gt;.  I think that if we can work with schools to provide some tutoring in computing at a younger age we might be able to attract kids who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have thought about programming as a career choice before.  Some of these may be women, some will not.  That&amp;rsquo;s fine, diversity is our ultimate goal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which leads me onto another point - special treatment of women.  I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before I&amp;rsquo;m sure - I think singling out women to attempt to increase their numbers does more harm than good, for a number of reasons: &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It makes women think that there must be something wrong in our industry if women need to be treated differently, or mentored differently, or need additional training to get by. Or it makes us think that we really aren&amp;rsquo;t as good as our male counterparts because we&amp;rsquo;re being given special treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It builds up resentment amongst our male colleagues, so they soon begin to wonder if we&amp;rsquo;re doing our job because we&amp;rsquo;re good at it, or if we got there because we got lots more help, or because we&amp;rsquo;re there to tick some sort of box&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not solving the problem of lack of overall diversity - where are the programs for people who went to the wrong schools, for those who didn&amp;rsquo;t think about programming as a career, for a million other special interest groups that exist out there?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some of the ideas that imply special treatment are things like: all women events (you should know by now &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/on-how-not-to-target-girl-geeks.html&#34;&gt;how I feel about those&lt;/a&gt;); free entry to conferences for women; higher pay for women at certain companies.  Although I would benefit from all of these things, I hate them.  I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m being compensated for this terrible affliction of being born female.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, what can we do?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reach out to those you want speaking at your conferences.  This might include women, it might include people from other &amp;ldquo;minorities&amp;rdquo;, or it might just be awesome people that you want there making your conference look good.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use these people for marketing and role models - it is indeed possible that if you have some female faces on your conference site and posters, you might attract more women attendees.  Actually, if you have more women role models you might attract more men, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s all about diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy your kids Lego and teach them programming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treat women in your company like people the same as anyone else.  We were asked about how to deal with a younger female boss.  Kim&amp;rsquo;s answer was perfect: &amp;ldquo;Like an older, male boss&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get involved in mentoring programmes, not just for women but for people of all ages - kids at school, undergraduates, or people who are already in the industry and want to take that next step, for example to speaking at conferences or writing or leading teams or becoming CTO.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Since the panel I&amp;rsquo;ve been pointed, numerous times, to this excellent article which talks about &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/19/racism-and-meritocracy/&#34;&gt;racism, sexism, and meritocracies&lt;/a&gt;.  I particularly like the line &amp;ldquo;Explicit diversity programs have the solution exactly backwards&amp;rdquo;.  Well worth a read.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and I pulled together four women for a panel on women technologists. &amp;nbsp;And once again, a lot of guys asking why this is, because they want things to change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A highlight was seeing my namesake, AutoTrish, up on a cinema-sized screen in front of hundreds of people at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davefarley.net/&#34;&gt;Dave Farley&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Continuous Delivery presentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building on from my twitter revelation at JAX London, I&#39;ve found twitter very useful here for messaging people I want to meet up with, but also for chatting to new people and making new friends. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not quite as intimate as JAX London though because there are billions more people here, so the chances of actually bumping into the twitter friends is much lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have had lots of interesting conversations with people about the Open JDK, which I guess is the logical extension of the interesting conversations I had about the JCP In San Francisco.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A community event like this is different to an event like Java One, because a single organisation isn&#39;t calling the shots. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s interesting (and great) that Oracle and Google can both be here talking about the cool stuff they&#39;re up to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;

I love learning stuff and indexing it away, possibly for future references; I love hanging out with people like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; guys (Ben, Martijn and John); I love kicking around ideas of what more we can do at LMAX with our lot (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davefarley.net/&#34;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;, Dali). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__i_learn_stuff_and_meet_people/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt; along with a number of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; regulars (&lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://jr0cket.com/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/members/5737653/&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://devangelist.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://zoah.co.uk/jax-london&#34;&gt;Zoe&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IjhCGApfG_A/TrlkKBsNZQI/AAAAAAAAIV0/Dsei_5U3TBY/s1600/IMGP0035.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IjhCGApfG_A/TrlkKBsNZQI/AAAAAAAAIV0/Dsei_5U3TBY/s400/IMGP0035.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;My purpose for attending was largely to present the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/mike-and-i-debut-our-new-disruptor.html&#34;&gt;Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; talk that &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back.  Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.  After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities.  Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sessions at JAX were of a very high standard, and I learnt something from every one.  I was pleasantly surprised by the calibre of international speakers that were there, and the sessions seemed to be pitched right for me personally, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Downsides:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover these first because I like to end on a high note.  Firstly, although I was interested in the Open JDK session at the community night, it was really on way too late (and after too much beer - i.e. more than none) to get the most out of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a shame that our session was the last presentation on the final day, by that time people&amp;rsquo;s brains are fried and we didn&amp;rsquo;t get as many questions, or as much interaction, as we usually would.  Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because everyone understood and agreed with us.  But we did get great feedback so I could be scraping the barrel for things to complain about.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The following sections outline the main takeaway points for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Software Craftsmanship / Design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/members/5737653/&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; did a great job emphasising that Software Craftsmanship is about professionalism, not beauty.  We should be doing the right thing because we want to, because it makes everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives easier in the long run, and because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the right thing to do, not because some process dictates that we do it.  The other thing that really struck me was how having a craftsman&amp;rsquo;s mindset leads to us taking ownership of our career and investing in it.  He also challenged us to stop being miserable and negative.  If we&amp;rsquo;re happy, we&amp;rsquo;ll attract more (presumably happy) people into our circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/&#34;&gt;Jason Gorman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s Slow and Dirty presentation showed that ignoring quality slows down delivery not just in the long run, in terms of maintainability, but also in the short run - a TDD exercise of approximately 30 minutes took less time to get right when done in a test driven fashion, despite that fact that we all still think writing tests takes too much time.  He pointed out that Twitter and Facebook are statistical aberrations - not every startup can afford to assume they will be bought out of their scalability problems.  There was lots of interesting stuff here about quality, which was pretty inspiring at the time but in retrospect, as a team that already does Test Driven Development almost to the extreme, I wonder what&amp;rsquo;s next for us to improve our quality even further.&lt;br /&gt;Simon Ritter&amp;rsquo;s keynote stated that code should be a joy to read, not simply easy to read, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/AdamBien&#34;&gt;Adam Bien&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s presentation talking about simplifying code: thinking about design, and not getting bogged down in unnecessary design patterns in order to implement something simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concurrency / Parallelism / Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZf05BIgfGY/Tr_GwtTq6zI/AAAAAAAAIV8/3GnJFWQYCig/s1600/5634379146_9838de9e9d_z.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LZf05BIgfGY/Tr_GwtTq6zI/AAAAAAAAIV8/3GnJFWQYCig/s400/5634379146_9838de9e9d_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Russel Winder&amp;rsquo;s session around message passing had me thinking.  It was particularly interesting to see him say things that are possibly the opposite of what we (the LMAX/Disruptor types) are preaching.  For example, that programmers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t care about the low-level details; that we should be using models (i.e. abstraction) to deal with parallelism; that you should let the JVM deal with thread management.  However, I think he&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally coming from the same place as us: &amp;ldquo;concurrency&amp;rdquo; in the past was not a good model, it was designed for old hardware that was trying to run multiple processes on a single core.  With multi-core systems you need to be running code in parallel instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Hardiker&amp;rsquo;s performance testing presentation was another one that reinforced that testing first, finding what the real performance is, profiling and then targeted experimentation are all fundamental to getting good performance.  There was a lot of good advice to how to write good performance tests too.&lt;br /&gt;Another point from Simon Ritter&amp;rsquo;s keynote reiterated that the performance free lunch was over, and we need to get better at writing parallel code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workshops&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Open JDK session and Ben and Martijn&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Spring cleaning your code base with Java 7&amp;rdquo; had me attempting to do things with my mac I never intended to do (i.e. write code).  Thanks to Ben and Martijn&amp;rsquo;s patience, I finally got IntelliJ playing nicely on the mac with Java 7, which was a challenge but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty pleased I&amp;rsquo;ve achieved it.  The Open JDK one was not as successful for me personally, but I got a good feel for the process of building it (i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s hard and it takes a very long time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other great stuff:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The keynote by James Governor from &lt;a href=&#34;http://redmonk.com/&#34;&gt;Redmonk&lt;/a&gt; was really thought-provoking.  So thought-provoking I wrote no notes and can&amp;rsquo;t remember any of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As last time, the Community night was really great.  I met new people and I hung out with some old favourites.  Dear God I must stop drinking with those guys. Hotel bars are particularly awful for losing track of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I heard about the Java 7+ features enough times from various people to be able to give an overview of the release plan to my geek friends in the pub on Friday (hey, they asked).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I learnt how to use twitter to bridge that gap between me and other attendees, and made new friends without having to do the scary thing of approaching strangers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The lunches we rather good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Going to a conference 20 minutes from home is a bonus.  Nice to meet other London devs as well as the European ones too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, it seems as if the relevance of the JCP is starting to seep out into the real(er) world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The tables for laptops at the front of the rooms was an awesome idea.  For a start, it encouraged people to get into the room early to get one of those seats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a great time at the conference, I learnt stuff and met people, which is all I really want.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For once, the photos aren&amp;rsquo;t mine.  &lt;i&gt;Images courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What&amp;hellip; exactly&amp;hellip; were you guys looking to get out of today&amp;rsquo;s event? Because&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Because we&amp;rsquo;re girls?&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Um&amp;hellip; yes&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim impetuously opts for The Truth: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re here to meet men.&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our interrogator looks round dubiously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;No, really, why are you here?&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phew.  My reputation is intact&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim eloquently describes what her situation is as Product Manager and the criteria she&amp;rsquo;s measuring third party products against.  I explain how LMAX aims to be the fastest retail exchange in the world, and therefore low latency is a tiny bit important to us.  I talk about how we created &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;The Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; on our path to achieve that goal.  The guys gathered around us look a little&amp;hellip; shell-shocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m exaggerating for Dramatic Effect.  Before anyone starts getting upset about the only two girls at the event who weren&amp;rsquo;t staff or hospitality being singled out, you have to give the guys credit.  They approached us, engaged us in conversation, and had a very serious question about what we were after, and was there anything the vendor could do to either improve their offering or to make their sales pitch more appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong - it&amp;rsquo;s brilliant being different in a situation like that, if people are brave / foolish / drunk enough to talk to you.  It beats the hell out of sitting in a corner trying to get up the nerve to speak to Strangers (been there, done that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is quite a contrast, even from the Java events (JAX London, Java One).  There, I was in a select group of people of the female persuasion.  But I was also part of a community, and treated as A Developer.  At very specialised events (low latency, high performance in particular) diversity is almost non-existent.  You can count the number of women on one hand (if you can see any at all) and even the developers wear suits (poor bastards).  However it would probably be better if you could hide your surprise at hearing technical terminology coming out of a woman&amp;rsquo;s mouth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But&amp;hellip; I kinda like it.  Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m an alien.  Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m special.  But if it means you make the extra effort to speak to me, I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;ldquo;Extra extra, read all about it! &lt;i&gt;Blogger And International Conference Speaker Only Does It To Meet Boys&lt;/i&gt;!&amp;rdquo;  Not quite &lt;i&gt;Jordan Stalks Rugby Ace For Sperm Donor&lt;/i&gt;.  Which I really did see this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: oh yes, and of course I forgot to plug my panel at Devoxx next week: &lt;a href=&#34;http://devoxx.com/display/DV11/Why+We+Shouldn%27t+Target+Women&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Why we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t target women&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late.  But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But before I move on, it&amp;rsquo;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and I are interviewed about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor &lt;/a&gt;winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object id=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;videoId=1203095587001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1203095587001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;base&#34; value=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;seamlesstabbing&#34; value=&#34;false&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;swLiveConnect&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; flashVars=&#34;videoId=1203095587001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1203095587001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; base=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; name=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; seamlesstabbing=&#34;false&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowScriptAccess=&#34;always&#34; swLiveConnect=&#34;true&#34; pluginspage=&#34;http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&amp;rsquo;m interviewed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt; about life, the universe and everything (well, the London Java Community, the JCP, the LMAX Disruptor and Duke Award, and women programmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;object classid=&#34;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&#34; codebase=&#34;http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; id=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34;&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;movie&#34; value=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;bgcolor&#34; value=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;flashVars&#34; value=&#34;videoId=1231299099001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1231299099001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;base&#34; value=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;seamlesstabbing&#34; value=&#34;false&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;swLiveConnect&#34; value=&#34;true&#34; /&gt;&lt;param name=&#34;allowScriptAccess&#34; value=&#34;always&#34; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&#34;http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&amp;isUI=1&#34; bgcolor=&#34;#FFFFFF&#34; flashVars=&#34;videoId=1231299099001&amp;linkBaseURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmedianetwork.oracle.com%2Fvideo%2Fplayer%2F1231299099001&amp;playerID=1217746023001&amp;playerKey=AQ~~,AAAAAFcSbzI~,OkyYKKfkn3x1llKvCBQgVazGCPhNSKRX&amp;domain=embed&amp;dynamicStreaming=true&#34; base=&#34;http://admin.brightcove.com&#34; name=&#34;flashObj&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; seamlesstabbing=&#34;false&#34; type=&#34;application/x-shockwave-flash&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;true&#34; allowScriptAccess=&#34;always&#34; swLiveConnect=&#34;true&#34; pluginspage=&#34;http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&#34;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On The Similarities Between Girls And Aliens</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/on_the_similarities_between_girls_and_aliens/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/on_the_similarities_between_girls_and_aliens/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered, through the power of the search words that lead to my blog, that there was &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/110635974610895095726/posts/fTygidL33cx&#34;&gt;an incident at JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; that once again opens the can of worms that is Sexism In IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Makes Me Sad.  I had a really positive experience at JavaOne.  In fact, I would say it was the one conference I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in the last 12 months where I felt like my gender &lt;i&gt;wasn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; a problem - I even got away with wearing hotpants (tweed is business-casual, right??) without being mistaken for anything other than a developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know incidents like this cause a lot of tension, and I want to explore why.  Get ready for some gross generalisations: women get upset because they feel they&amp;rsquo;re being marginalised or treated differently; men get upset because they think we&amp;rsquo;re being over-sensitive, especially when the cause is something unintentional.  I sometimes wonder, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure other people do, if perhaps picking up every incident harms our cause more than advancing it.  But then I feel that the unconscious stuff is exactly the stuff that needs to be pointed out - if you don&amp;rsquo;t realise you&amp;rsquo;re causing a problem, you can&amp;rsquo;t change your behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I wanted to do was&amp;hellip; well, what I wanted to do was not rant about gender (again) and be a good little non-gendered programmer.  But then I thought that spreading a bit of understanding might be A Good Thing.  After all, we&amp;rsquo;re all about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_improvement_process&#34;&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/a&gt;, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure many people have been one of a minority at some point in their lives (brace yourselves for a litany of stereotyping) - the only man at their daughter&amp;rsquo;s dance recital; the only white guy on a basketball team; the only straight guy in a gay bar (accidents happen!); the only girl on the development team&amp;hellip;  Speaking for myself, in those situations I&amp;rsquo;m not actually looking for things which prove that I&amp;rsquo;m Not One Of Them.  I&amp;rsquo;m sub-consciously seeking reassurance that I&amp;rsquo;m not an alien, a freak of nature, the odd one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in mostly male environments for the last 16 years - this is the norm for me, it&amp;rsquo;s my life.  It freaks me out if I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by women actually.  What&amp;rsquo;s jarring and uncomfortable is when the difference of your gender becomes apparent: when all the t-shirts are boy-shaped and boy-sized; when someone makes a joke about &amp;ldquo;women&amp;rdquo;; when someone addresses the room with &amp;ldquo;Gentlemen&amp;rdquo; - or worse, they try and make up for it: &amp;ldquo;Gentlemen.  Oh, and Ladies.  Well, Lady &amp;lt;nervous smile&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;.  Thanks, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make me feel like an outsider &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that really highlights the difference in genders is when you have plenty of women at the conference&amp;hellip; but they&amp;rsquo;re not the attendees.  They&amp;rsquo;re manning the booths (marketing/sales or just plain hired &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;), they&amp;rsquo;re taking tickets, they&amp;rsquo;re dishing out the lunches.  In these cases, it becomes normal to assume that &amp;ldquo;girl&amp;rdquo; = &amp;ldquo;staff&amp;rdquo;.  Not guest.  Not equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/04/tradetech-2011-not-like-developer.html&#34;&gt;TradeTech&lt;/a&gt; was one of the worst examples of this that I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced.  Those (wo)manning the booths had been chosen for their aesthetics not their knowledge.  There was even entertainment consisting of scantily clad stilt-walkers - at a financial conference!  I made the mistake of turning up in a skirt - for those who know my dress sense, it was not one of my arse-length ones, it was just above my knees - and everyone assumed I was selling something. I had a job to persuade them that I had actually paid for my ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.  What am I trying to get at?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not trying to make you uncomfortable when we point out tiny accidental possibly maybe sexist or sexist-seeming comments/incidents.  We&amp;rsquo;re trying to stamp out behaviour that can subconsciously be pushing women (or other minorities/groups) out of our industry.  We like it here, we want to stay, and we want others to join us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to alienate people who are not 100% comfortable in your environment.  Every time I see t-shirts in boys size only I&amp;rsquo;m reminded I&amp;rsquo;m Not One Of You.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;hellip;and what can we do?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well, the t-shirts is an easy one.  So easy, and so stupid, you might not think it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile.  Especially as people like me don&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; your free t-shirt.  But I want to feel like you wanted me to want it.  Please stock some skinny-fit tees in multiple sizes, and stock smalls and mediums of the normal shape.  There are guys who would like this too.  Even if you can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of your skinny tees, it will do wonders for your image.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never assume your audience is all male.  Never even assume it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mostly&amp;rdquo; male.  If your sister/girlfriend/mother/daughter might frown at something you&amp;rsquo;re saying, don&amp;rsquo;t say it.  You&amp;rsquo;ll look like an idiot.  You can assume your audience is all technical, and joke about managers, or is all Java, and take the mickey out of C#.  Don&amp;rsquo;t draw arbitrary battle lines based on gender/race/origin - any jokes should make all the audience feel included, not like specific individuals are excluded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s already been a lot said elsewhere about encouraging women speakers at events.  I&amp;rsquo;m totally behind this, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fine line because I&amp;rsquo;m also totally against positive discrimination.  For the purposes of this blog, I would just say make sure you have some women on your speakers list, in the same way you would probably ensure you have a Java 7 talk, or a talk on the shiniest new technology, or other miscellaneous checkboxes you need to tick in order to make your conference a success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure what to suggest around many of the girls there being staff&amp;hellip; I guess something simple like clear uniforms would stop people assuming female delegates are there to hand out lunch.  And making sure that your staff/helpers/organisers are of both genders too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this whole topic, or want to tell me I&amp;rsquo;m wrong to my face, come along my panel at Devoxx - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Why+We+Shouldn%27t+Target+Women&#34;&gt;Why We Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Target Women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/32877942/&#34;&gt;Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;.  This was a preview of the talk we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/2011/sessions/?tid=2175&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd November.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/30781988&#34;&gt;video of the session&lt;/a&gt; is available, as are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/understanding-the-disruptor&#34;&gt;the slides&lt;/a&gt;.  I promise not to say &amp;ldquo;so&amp;rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the session went really really well.  We got some great questions at the end, we had an audience that was engaged, and I was dead pleased we didn&amp;rsquo;t lose anyone with the assembly language.  We had some very valuable feedback afterwards too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as our presentation, there were three great lightning talks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Somay Nakhal on Java Thread States&lt;/b&gt; - Somay gave a nice overview of thread lifecycles with code and some great diagrams.  I liked how he made this more applicable to the real world than the sort of book examples you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/gedb&#34;&gt;Ged Byrne&lt;/a&gt; on the shiny new &lt;a href=&#34;http://ljcbookclub.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/coherence-3-5-book-review/&#34;&gt;LJC Book Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - Ged reminded us how great it is to read an actual, paper book.  How committing to reading page by page forces you to learn in a different way to jumping around internet references that might not give you the context you need.  I thought this was a great presentation with humour, and I liked the way he challenged us to &amp;ldquo;expand our minds&amp;rdquo;.  Although the actual book he was reviewing was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=%22http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847196128/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1847196128%22%3EOracle%20Coherence%203.5%3C/a%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1847196128&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369%22%20width=%221%22%20height=%221%22%20border=%220%22%20alt=%22%22%20style=%22border:none%20!important;%20margin:0px%20!important;%22%20/%3E&#34;&gt;Oracle Coherence 3.5&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I need to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=%22http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456438786/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1456438786%22%3EBeautiful%20Software%3C/a%3E%3Cimg%20src=%22http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1456438786&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399373%22%20width=%221%22%20height=%221%22%20border=%220%22%20alt=%22%22%20style=%22border:none%20!important;%20margin:0px%20!important;%22%20/%3E&#34;&gt;Beautiful Software&lt;/a&gt;, which Ged quoted at the end of the talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Peter Lawrey&lt;/a&gt; on Common Java Misconceptions&lt;/b&gt; - A session which plays well with what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to preach when we talk about &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/amsterdam-2011/presentation/Tackling%20the%20folklore%20surrounding%20high%20performance%20computing&#34;&gt;Tackling Folklore&lt;/a&gt;.  He covered a few topics that are assumed to be &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo;.  For example, dealing with garbage collection is not a &lt;i&gt;mandatory&lt;/i&gt; part of writing Java - you could write GC-friendly code for a start.  Also it&amp;rsquo;s naive to assume the JDK is written in an efficient way, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s actually dug around it for a while will realise that newer, more efficient methods of programming have not been applied to all areas of the (massive) existing code base.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s great to have people out there talking about this stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s too easy to make assumptions and take things for granted.  The most important thing he said: &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re told something, don&amp;rsquo;t just believe it - test it yourself first&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/ul&gt;All of us (me, Mike and the lightning talk presenters) got such a great response it has encouraged us at the LJC to try and push for more real developers presenting their experiences.  We have a lot of great presentations from vendors, but what&amp;rsquo;s more applicable to Java guys and girls across the board is other developers sharing the problems they&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve and how they go about that process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very much looking forward to presenting this again at JAX. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>JavaOne 2011: Roundup</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011_roundup/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011_roundup/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Having been back in London for a few days I&amp;rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive.  Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not jaded yet.  But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/10/java-one-initial-observations.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s1600/bruno.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;219&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RlwrbbMeTWI/TpWq7Aw_7OI/AAAAAAAAIQ0/UiDjINFvXjo/s320/bruno.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First and foremost, the people.  I don&amp;rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person. Everyone I spoke to was there to get the most out of the experience, regardless of how many times they&amp;rsquo;d been previously.  In my experience, techies are not conditioned to be socially comfortable, yet introductions were made and the conversations flowed easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of course it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the attendees who were friendly, the staff and organisers were approachable and helpful, and it was nice to have people hanging around to direct you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the (few) advantages of having the event over multiple hotels was the outdoor space between them.  It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that it rained,  but I really liked being able to hang around outside.  I especially liked that they had provided power points for your laptop, so you didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be cooped up indoors to update your blog.  I also thought that having to walk between the venues was good exercise, given I didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the gym last week. However I can see why people want to move the event back to one central location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s1600/martijn.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;200&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UOsWpFnYjSw/TpWrGSgqheI/AAAAAAAAIQ8/Hx8nyX5S3uA/s200/martijn.jpg&#34; width=&#34;177&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I personally found the sessions less useful than the networking.  I mostly attended the high-performance / concurrency sessions, but I probably should have been to ones about things I &lt;i&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; know (e.g. other JVM languages).  My favourite session was &lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Diabolical Developer session, but then I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of stand-up comedy.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Another favourite was the &lt;a href=&#34;http://javaposse.com/&#34;&gt;Java Posse&lt;/a&gt; live podcast.  I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to admit that I&amp;rsquo;ve never listened to one before (my excuse: I don&amp;rsquo;t listen to podcasts at all because I don&amp;rsquo;t have a long commute to work, which would be the ideal time).  I thought it was great how everyone felt like a part of the Java Posse and not a passive audience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s1600/javaposse.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8az7qiRldX8/TpWro5J2Z2I/AAAAAAAAIRM/fCD-liE8g9o/s320/javaposse.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really felt that Oracle was trying its best to invoke the spirit of community.  Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in sessions or having random conversations, I was in Java User Group or &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/home/index&#34;&gt;Java Community Process&lt;/a&gt; events.  It seems pretty clear to me that the inclusion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://soujava.org.br/&#34;&gt;SouJava&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; in the JCP EC has shaken things up a bit.  But then, I would say that - I&amp;rsquo;m biased.  But the vibe I was getting across the whole conference was that having the community involved in this key decision-making organisation is a step forward.  I would even go so far as to claim that it inspired a number of other players to seriously consider getting on board rather than complaining from the sidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s1600/jduchess.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;145&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vuIJB2I4Elo/TpWrcuMqwoI/AAAAAAAAIRE/M8Y6MkPZW6E/s320/jduchess.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On a related note, I really enjoyed the final &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/systemobject/@mktg_admin/documents/webcontent/videoplayer-ocom.html?bctid=1176404830001&amp;amp;playerID=single-social&amp;amp;size=events&#34;&gt;keynote on community&lt;/a&gt;. To me, that was an indication that Oracle takes our participation very seriously.  I liked that it was split into a lot of different interviews and panels, all quite short, which showcased the variety of the Java platform community.  I came out of that feeling pretty warm and fluffy about the future of our technology, and proud to be an active part of it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stuff I was not so bothered about:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vendor keynotes.  Pretty dull to be honest.  I understand why they had them but after the first one I didn&amp;rsquo;t turn up to any more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The other bad points I already mentioned in the last post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personal highlights:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s1600/intro-to-disruptor.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;154&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aovhDAhVoKI/TpWryE1AKMI/AAAAAAAAIRU/vnwMqPGquSQ/s200/intro-to-disruptor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Picking up the Duke&amp;rsquo;s Choice Award (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/ocom/groups/public/@ocom/documents/digitalasset/512339.jpg&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; - note: only seems to work in Firefox for me) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll shut up about it at some point, let me have my moment of glory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Co-presenting a session on the Disruptor with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;.  He invited me to stand up with him when we realised I could go to the event, and I was terrified of the thought.  So I did it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meeting and being interviewed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;JDuchess&lt;/a&gt; ladies.  The video doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available, so maybe I was rubbish, but it was a cool thing for me all the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talking about the Disruptor for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.oracle.com/javaspotlight/entry/java_spotlight_episode_51_live&#34;&gt;Java Spotlight Podcast&lt;/a&gt; and the Oracle news guys (again, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the content for this yet).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a really brilliant time, and would love to repeat the experience again as soon as possible!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it&amp;rsquo;s time to record some of my observations so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;Gross generalisation&amp;gt; technical people are not natural public speakers.  Makes me feel better about the presentations I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/32877942/&#34;&gt;A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&amp;rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jduchess.org/&#34;&gt;Duchess&lt;/a&gt; girls; other Duke Award winners; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.azulsystems.com/&#34;&gt;Azul&lt;/a&gt; guys; guys (well, girls) from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everyone thinks that Large is an acceptable default t-shirt size (it&amp;rsquo;s not).  Vendors - if you&amp;rsquo;re really serious about appealing to The Other Gender you need to stock XS, if not actual skinny tees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a conference, you should probably have your projection screens &lt;i&gt;above&lt;/i&gt; the height of the audience members&amp;rsquo; heads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People at JavaOne are dead friendly.  I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in a lot of conversations just by virtue of standing alone for longer than 30 seconds.  It is noticeably easier to talk to people here than at the conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending in London.  Not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s a location thing or a domain thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socialising in London is &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/09/what-my-hangovers-can-teach-you-about.html&#34;&gt;great practice&lt;/a&gt; for this sort of event.  I am capable of taking advantage of free drink and still maintaining a conversation and staying upright in 6 inch heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I miss American breakfasts.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been gorging myself on pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and eggs benedict.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be calling my personal trainer as soon as I return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything to contradict my view that San Francisco is not the Brit&amp;rsquo;s typical view of California - the weather is rubbish.  London has been hotter and sunnier this week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing an apartment with your CTO is not as weird as you might think.  Especially if you relegate him to the closet (no, that&amp;rsquo;s not a euphemism).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to remember to Tweet or blog when you&amp;rsquo;re totally engrossed in conversations with people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a photo of me representing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; as I pick up the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.com/en/dukeschoice/index.jsp&#34;&gt;Duke Award&lt;/a&gt; we won for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s1600/duke.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;313&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z4fj8X89gh8/TouHpDgIy4I/AAAAAAAAIKs/v_3k_WC8rCU/s320/duke.JPG&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; (Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt; for taking the photo).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was grabbed for an interview which should be available (un-edited - erk!) on &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.net/&#34;&gt;java.net&lt;/a&gt; at some point, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it when it&amp;rsquo;s available (if it&amp;rsquo;s not rubbish).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/javaone_2011/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m off to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html&#34;&gt;JavaOne&lt;/a&gt; next week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be there with &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; fame), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt; (that&amp;rsquo;s not going to get confusing at all).  Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&amp;hellip; everything.  Most importantly for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; he&amp;rsquo;s representing us in our &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/05/london-java-community-elected-to-jcp.html&#34;&gt;shiny new JCP Executive Committee&lt;/a&gt; role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&amp;rsquo;ll talk to me.  It&amp;rsquo;s the first international conference I&amp;rsquo;ve been to and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to meet people I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get a chance to see in London.  It&amp;rsquo;s also really cool to be able to represent both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; and the London Java Community. Hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t lead to some sort of split personality syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost more excitingly, I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a spot of shopping in New York on the way there and back. Because, well, it would be rude to fly over to the States and not drop in on my old home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to catch up with some of you in one of those amazing cities&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; class=&#34;b-hbp-video b-uploaded&#34; id=&#34;BLOGGER-video-287f97612eb2190a-12841&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;mozallowfullscreen&#34; src=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dxMgF0oRwPmf_KxmkPsMwUzxaWCHfwJ3TR3busIpd12zKNl7T2QtqD8UN_hk6tINsNpjeaC54zjjwgdd4NQ5DJ6mg_NUy3_G1HV4QjxrfnEtXXju7x4PqpM7G0BMfVCl1WivKvd&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;webkitallowfullscreen&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember a while back I talked about &lt;a href=&#34;post/my-first-public-appearance&#34;&gt;my first public appearance&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I chased down the video, because I&amp;rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my
mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&amp;rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw
myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&amp;rsquo;t see me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/trishagee/introduction-to-the-java-community-process&#34;&gt;available for
all to enjoy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.playfish.com/&#34;&gt;Playfish&lt;/a&gt; for hosting the event - as always, their
hospitality was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that they didn&amp;rsquo;t serve wine is probably a Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What my hangovers can teach you about Agile</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_my_hangovers_can_teach_you_about_agile/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/what_my_hangovers_can_teach_you_about_agile/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;As a survival trait for living and working in the cites&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers.  If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is.  Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.  I&amp;rsquo;ll let you into a secret and tell you my nightly ritual:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Floss and clean teeth (OK I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I barely floss when I&amp;rsquo;m sober let alone drunk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleanse/tone/moisturise (I&amp;rsquo;m a rubbish girl, this is a very recent ritual for me)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sallyhansen.co.uk/products/diamond-cuticle-nail-cream&#34;&gt;cuticle cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do my calf stretches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drink 500ml of water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat something, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a dirty McDonalds (quarter pounder with cheese, no pickle no onion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Prior to all this is the additional requirement “don&amp;rsquo;t drink more than a bottle and a half of wine”.  Everyone has their limits, &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of practice means I know full well what mine are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This actually works for me.  I won&amp;rsquo;t claim to feel capable of being quite as high performance as the code I&amp;rsquo;m working on, but I won&amp;rsquo;t feel like killing myself, and I will make it to the gym before work and do a whole day of productive coding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to solve a similar problem (“no debilitating hangovers”), you might try and follow my rituals.  But you might decide that drinking the water was going to mean you had to go to the loo in the night, and strike that off the list.  You might be on a diet, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have the food, thinking the alcohol is calories enough for the night.  And you&amp;rsquo;ll follow everything else religiously, but still have hangovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you might ignore the alcohol intake guidelines, thinking the stuff that you do at home to repair the damage should be enough, and drink 12 pints of margaritas.  Or you might be the sort of person who can only get away with drinking a couple of glasses of wine / pints of beer, and follow my rules perfectly, but still feel like dying the next day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when this happens you&amp;rsquo;ll look at my rituals and think &amp;ldquo;What a waste of time!  This person has no idea what they&amp;rsquo;re talking about&amp;rdquo;, and throw the whole lot out of the window and go back to doing waterfall development (oh wait, I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you&amp;rsquo;ll do the bits that actually prevent the hangover (the water, the food, restricting alchol) and go around telling the interweb I have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about because the other stuff is a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key point here is that this works for &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s foolish of me to tell the world this will fix all their problems, and pointless for others to copy it without realising &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they&amp;rsquo;re doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example – why on Earth is “apply cuticle cream” on there? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually fix the problem of dehydration due to excessive alcohol intake.  But it&amp;rsquo;s important to me, because I need to make the time to do the whole ritual to get my brain into the right place for sleep.  It&amp;rsquo;s also dead important for my subconscious – alcohol is basically abuse of my body, the beauty part of the regime is to remind my brain that its important to take care of myself too.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t fix the immediate issue of hangover the next day, but it aims to prevent future problems of drowning my sorrows in alcohol.  It&amp;rsquo;s an important part of my Long Term Plan – these rituals need to be worked into the daily steps to lead eventually to World Domination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And calf stretches?  Well, I&amp;rsquo;m injured, have had shin splints for a million years.  If I want to run the Royal Parks Half Marathon in October, I need to stretch 3 times a day.  Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I&amp;rsquo;m drunk or not, it&amp;rsquo;s not an excuse.  The half marathon is a very important longer-term goal.  But &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it.  Well, unless you have the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing is that all of these rituals are tied to a goal.  But they&amp;rsquo;re not the same goal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Floss and clean teeth.  GOAL – don&amp;rsquo;t get told off by the dentist.  Don&amp;rsquo;t require fillings - costs money and not great for overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleanse/tone/moisturise.  GOAL – prepare subconscious for sleep and remind brain that body needs love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply cuticle cream.  GOAL – prepare subconscious for sleep and remind brain that body needs love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do my calf stretches GOAL – Royal Parks Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drink 500ml of water GOAL – prevent Debilitating Hangover&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat something, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a dirty McDonalds GOAL – prevent Debilitating Hangover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The thing here is that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t do the stuff to aim towards longer-term goals, I might be more inclined to drink more out of boredom or despair, I might have worse hangovers in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To paraphrase Eddie Izzard “&amp;hellip;and that&amp;rsquo;s like &lt;strike&gt;our Lord Jesus&lt;/strike&gt; the agile process&amp;hellip;”.  Agile, in whatever form you take it (actually all processes) is supposed to enable you as a team / organisation to work better.  Whichever cult you follow, there are practices designed to work for you to make you more productive.  But you do have to continuously improve, gather and act on feedback, and, most importantly, to know why you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.  Otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult&#34;&gt;cargo cultism&lt;/a&gt; – you look like you&amp;rsquo;re doing everything, but the results just don&amp;rsquo;t arrive.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericgu/archive/2006/10/13/scrumbut.aspx&#34;&gt;scrum-but&lt;/a&gt; company – they had the cards, short iterations, invested customers.  But no single product owner, they never acted on the results of retrospectives, and most importantly the team didn&amp;rsquo;t own the work they&amp;rsquo;d signed up to.  They also had a project manager who told people what they were doing.  This doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer the question.  This is drinking 12 pints of scrumpy and doing &amp;ldquo;cleanse/tone/moisturise&amp;rdquo;, and wondering why it still hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to understand the problem. You can&amp;rsquo;t blindly follow the stuff that you fancy, the stuff you find easy.  If it&amp;rsquo;s easy, it&amp;rsquo;s probably something you were already doing.  If you picked up agile to make a change to deliver more/better/faster, there is going to be some pain.  Because if what you were doing before was working, you&amp;rsquo;d carry on doing it.  So improvement is going to be &lt;i&gt;hard&lt;/i&gt;.  At first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to stick with it, to check progress, to continuously improve.  To find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Random fact of the day: London is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lightuplondon.com/london-facts/12040.html&#34;&gt;actually two cities&lt;/a&gt;, the City of London and the City of Westminster.  But you probably already knew that.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/09/02/effective_sketches_at_skills_matter.html&#34;&gt;Simon Brown&amp;rsquo;s Effective Sketches&lt;/a&gt; session at &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/&#34;&gt;Skillsmatter&lt;/a&gt;.  Just because my pictures are pretty awesome doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there&amp;rsquo;s no opportunity for continuous learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The points Simon made in the session really made sense to me, and I wish I could have had something like that as a primer when they taught us UML at university.  Without the context of what the diagrams were supposed to mean, to convey, all the boxes and lines made no sense to me back then.  I&amp;rsquo;m still not a fan of large chunks of UML because I think the convention sometimes gets in the way of real meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take-away points were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try and squidge everything onto a single diagram.  The reason lots of different flavours of architecture diagrams exist (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/logical-view.html&#34;&gt;logical view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/infrastructure-view.html&#34;&gt;infrastructure view&lt;/a&gt;, etc) is because you have different audiences for each of the diagrams and different things that are important when you&amp;rsquo;re looking at it from one particular angle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One diagram you particularly need, especially if you are producing a stack of documentation for a system (e.g. you&amp;rsquo;re a consultant presenting findings to the client) is a really &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/pages/book/context-view.html&#34;&gt;succinct, summary view&lt;/a&gt; of what the system is actually trying to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not going to use UML, you should at least agree on consistency and some conventions - for example, does the direction of an arrow represent data flow or dependency?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UML tools make it easier to represent different views of a data model and retain consistency.  One diagram is less likely to contradict a different view if your sketching tool points this mistake out to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, your code should be self-documenting.  But you can&amp;rsquo;t give the code to your business customers or expect your hardware guys to figure out your requirements from it.  To pass knowledge around the business it&amp;rsquo;s more efficient to have diagrams representing the shared understanding of the domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architecture diagrams should show the intent and the vision of the system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also used my laptop to take notes for the first time.  In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve preferred not to use a laptop, because a) I like pencil and paper and it allows me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/phq_PRPQOYxViiz4Il6ONDDlgmlkuyHYOu3BaLXdFVg?feat=directlink&#34;&gt;doodle&lt;/a&gt; and b) the temptation to read my e-mail or check facebook is not something I want to succumb to.  But &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/2011/08/27/using_evernote_for_training_courses.html&#34;&gt;using Evernote&lt;/a&gt; really worked for me, I could annotate the slides with my notes, and it made converting my notes into this post a lot easier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;PS it has not escaped me that this is one post without a diagram.  The irony is not lost on me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Disruptor 2.0 - All Change Please</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/disruptor_20__all_change_please/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-released.html&#34;&gt;announced version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; - basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&amp;rsquo;s time to mark that officially.  His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again.  Now I see the disadvantage of hand-drawing everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the old world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R3vHFiqPCPo/TlvTk9cQEvI/AAAAAAAAIKA/1-o7vhoxGnQ/s1600/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R3vHFiqPCPo/TlvTk9cQEvI/AAAAAAAAIKA/1-o7vhoxGnQ/s640/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an example of a configuration of the Disruptor (specifically a diamond configuration).  If none of this means anything to you, feel free to go back and refresh yourself on all the (now outdated) &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/search/label/disruptor&#34;&gt;Disruptor details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most obvious changes over the last few weeks have been:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated naming convention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrating the producer barrier into the ring buffer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symphonious.net/2011/07/11/lmax-disruptor-high-performance-low-latency-and-simple-too/&#34;&gt;Disruptor wizard&lt;/a&gt; into the main code base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New World Order&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4aCmflSb7Fs/TlvZ5z8BesI/AAAAAAAAIKE/kAXR_7Ly5FI/s1600/NewWorldOrder.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;219&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4aCmflSb7Fs/TlvZ5z8BesI/AAAAAAAAIKE/kAXR_7Ly5FI/s640/NewWorldOrder.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see the fundamentals are pretty much the same.  It&amp;rsquo;s simpler, because the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; is no longer an entity in its own right - its replacement is the &lt;code&gt;PublishPort&lt;/code&gt; interface, which is implemented by the &lt;code&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similarly the name &lt;code&gt;DependencyBarrier&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; clarifies the job of this object; &lt;code&gt;Publisher&lt;/code&gt; (instead of &lt;code&gt;Producer&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;EventProcessor&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; also more accurately represent what these things do.  There was always a little confusion over the name &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;, since consumers never actually consumed anything from the ring buffer.  It was simply a term that we hoped would make sense to those who were used to queue implementations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not shown on the diagram is the name change of the items in the &lt;code&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/code&gt; - in the old world, we called this &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt;, now they&amp;rsquo;re an &lt;code&gt;Event&lt;/code&gt;, hence &lt;code&gt;EventProcessor&lt;/code&gt; at the other end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The aim of this wholesale rename has not been to completely discredit all my old blogs so I can continue blogging about the Disruptor &lt;i&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/i&gt;. This is far from what I want - I have other, more fluffy, things to write about.  The aim of the rename is to make it easier to understand how the Disruptor works and how to use it. Although &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; use the Disruptor for event processing, when we open sourced it we wanted it to look like a general purpose solution, so the naming convention tried to represent that.  But in fact the event processing model does seem more intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;No more tedious wiring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symphonious.net/2011/08/13/the-disruptor-wizard-is-dead-long-live-the-disruptor-wizard/&#34;&gt;Disruptor wizard is part of the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; itself, my whole &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html&#34;&gt;post on wiring&lt;/a&gt; is pretty pointless - which is good, actually, because it was a little involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days, if you want to create the diamond pattern (for example the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/perf/com/lmax/disruptor/DiamondPath1P3CPerfTest.java?r=294&#34;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt; performance test), it&amp;rsquo;s a lot simpler:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;DisruptorWizard dw = new DisruptorWizard&amp;lt;FizzBuzzEvent&amp;gt;(&lt;br /&gt;                         ENTRY_FACTORY, &lt;br /&gt;                         RING_BUFFER_SIZE, &lt;br /&gt;                         EXECUTOR,&lt;br /&gt;                         ClaimStrategy.Option.SINGLE_THREADED,&lt;br /&gt;                         WaitStrategy.Option.YIELDING);&lt;br /&gt;FizzBuzzEventHandler fizzHandler = &lt;br /&gt;                         new FizzBuzzEventHandler(FIZZ);&lt;br /&gt;FizzBuzzEventHandler buzzHandler = &lt;br /&gt;                         new FizzBuzzEventHandler(BUZZ);&lt;br /&gt;FizzBuzzEventHandler fizzBuzzHandler = &lt;br /&gt;                         new FizzBuzzEventHandler(FIZZ_BUZZ);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dw.handleEventsWith(fizzHandler, buzzHandler)&lt;br /&gt;  .then(fizzBuzzHandler);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RingBuffer ringBuffer = dw.start();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/wiki/DisruptorWizard&#34;&gt;Wiki page&lt;/a&gt; on the Disruptor Wizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other changes: performance improvements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Martin mentions in &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-released.html&#34;&gt;his post&lt;/a&gt;, he&amp;rsquo;s managed to significantly improve the performance (even more!) of the Disruptor in 2.0. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version of this is that there is a shiny new class, &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt;, which both takes care of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-why-its-so-fast_22.html&#34;&gt;cache line padding&lt;/a&gt;, and removes the need for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/08/dissecting-disruptor-why-its-so-fast.html&#34;&gt;memory barriers&lt;/a&gt;.  The cache line padding is now done slightly differently because, bless Java 7&amp;rsquo;s little cotton socks, it managed to &amp;ldquo;optimise&amp;rdquo; our old technique away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you to read the details over there, in this post I just wanted to give a quick summary of the changes and explain why my old diagrams may no longer be correct.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;And now, a post for my long-neglected, less technical readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a week off in July to try and avoid that Oh My God I Missed Summer Again feeling.  Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get that in the UK even if you&amp;rsquo;re not stuck in an office the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really this is just an excuse to post some photos on the blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOMqqFVCFi8/TkY2yVOPIiI/AAAAAAAAIJs/5vZHMmyqubk/s1600/Embankment.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;268&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mOMqqFVCFi8/TkY2yVOPIiI/AAAAAAAAIJs/5vZHMmyqubk/s400/Embankment.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopped on the bike and explored from Kensington to Westminster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt distinctly smug when I grabbed my lunch from Victoria amongst all the less fortunate people who had to go back to their offices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WxvvRy0iE9w/TkY3P8gtp_I/AAAAAAAAIJw/qXE_1DbSUV4/s1600/Gull.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WxvvRy0iE9w/TkY3P8gtp_I/AAAAAAAAIJw/qXE_1DbSUV4/s400/Gull.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to dose up on Culture, and went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/&#34;&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.  Last time I was there I was eight years old, and I distinctly remember admiring the frames more than the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rather marvellous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artfinder.com/&#34;&gt;Artfinder&lt;/a&gt; makes up for the fact that you can&amp;rsquo;t take photos inside the gallery - I can share most of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artfinder.com/user/4229/collection/tuesday/public/&#34;&gt;pieces that struck me&lt;/a&gt; when I was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-THH2_9dBQL8/TkY6P5ka5zI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/IHCur57_naA/s1600/Secret.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-THH2_9dBQL8/TkY6P5ka5zI/AAAAAAAAIJ0/IHCur57_naA/s400/Secret.jpg&#34; width=&#34;267&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally got around to embarking on one of the walks in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Secret-London-Exploring-Original-Unusual/dp/1566566363?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Secret London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1566566363&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;.  I chose to do the City, from St Paul&amp;rsquo;s, covering Bank, Monument and Liverpool St.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fascinating. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a lot of places round there, socialise there regularly, and have explored a number of the nooks and crannies.  But I was astounded at how many places I had never seen, alleys I had no idea existed, and gardens hidden away between modern office blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WyWhmBr0Ay8/TkY7VjTQQRI/AAAAAAAAIJ4/5TJmXfQ_644/s1600/LondonBridge.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WyWhmBr0Ay8/TkY7VjTQQRI/AAAAAAAAIJ4/5TJmXfQ_644/s400/LondonBridge.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents dropped by and I racked my brain for a different way to explore this massive, old city.  And it came to me: using the artery of the city - the river.  So we took a boat to Greenwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where they were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wharf.co.uk/2011/07/batman-filming-in-greenwich.html&#34;&gt;filming Batman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know until after we&amp;rsquo;d left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gutted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WTSxxolJIlg/TkY7vahoneI/AAAAAAAAIJ8/VIteMVNt6Uo/s1600/Sky.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;267&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WTSxxolJIlg/TkY7vahoneI/AAAAAAAAIJ8/VIteMVNt6Uo/s400/Sky.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sun finally makes an appearance. I was going to write a blog post, but I refuse to be indoors on a sunny day if I can get outside for some Vitamin D production (and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bought my &lt;a href=&#34;http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air&#34;&gt;new shiny&lt;/a&gt; then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sat in the park, sunbathed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent slow-down in posting is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier&#34;&gt;memory barriers&lt;/a&gt; and their applicability in &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject.  I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don&amp;rsquo;t really get, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.  Martin has written a post &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/memory-barriersfences.html&#34;&gt;going into memory barriers&lt;/a&gt; in some detail, so hopefully I can get away with skimming the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: any errors in the explanation are completely my own, and no reflection on the implementation of the Disruptor or on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX &lt;/a&gt;guys who actually do know about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the point?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main aim in this series of blog posts is to explain how the Disruptor works and, to a slightly lesser extent, why.  In theory I should be able to provide a bridge between the code and &lt;a href=&#34;http://disruptor.googlecode.com/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;the technical paper&lt;/a&gt; by talking about it from the point of view of a developer who might want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper mentioned memory barriers, and I wanted to understand what they were, and how they apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a Memory Barrier?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a CPU instruction.  Yes, once again, we&amp;rsquo;re thinking about CPU-level stuff in order to get the performance we need (Martin&amp;rsquo;s famous Mechanical Sympathy).  Basically it&amp;rsquo;s an instruction to a) ensure the order in which certain operations are executed and b) influence visibility of some data (which might be the result of executing some instruction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compilers and CPUs can re-order instructions, provided the end result is the same, to try and optimise performance.  Inserting a memory barrier tells the CPU and the compiler that what happened before that command needs to stay before that command, and what happens after needs to stay after.  All similarities to a trip to Vegas are entirely in your own mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wae8jx9Ehuw/Tjg5oFT5M7I/AAAAAAAAIJI/J00e1Fy42DU/s1600/MemoryBarrier.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

style=&#34;font-family: monospace;&#34;&gt;volatile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;&gt;, the Java Memory Model inserts a write barrier instruction after you write to it, and a read barrier instruction before you read from it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mdQ0VfzF_XM/TjhOOM4PBEI/AAAAAAAAIJQ/K25fNMkKufU/s1600/MemoryBarrierWrite.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means if you write to a volatile field, you know that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any thread accessing that field after the point at which you wrote to it will get the updated value &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anything you did before you wrote that field is guaranteed to have happened and any updated data values will also be visible, because the memory barrier flushed all earlier writes to the cache.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example please!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So glad you asked.  It&amp;rsquo;s about time I started drawing doughnuts again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/RingBuffer.java&#34;&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt; is one of these magic volatile thingies, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons we can get away with implementing the Disruptor without locking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_JxCXwReRgA/TjhGfFrokHI/AAAAAAAAIJM/i_VC0M_K5hw/s1600/BarriersWriteExample.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Producer will obtain the next &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/AbstractEntry.java?spec=svn109&amp;amp;r=201&#34;&gt;Entry&lt;/a&gt; (or batch of them) and do whatever it needs to do to the entries, updating them with whatever values it wants to place in there.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html&#34;&gt;As you know&lt;/a&gt;, at the end of all the changes the producer calls the commit method on the ring buffer, which updates the sequence number.  This write of the volatile field (&lt;code&gt;cursor&lt;/code&gt;) creates a memory barrier which ultimately brings all the caches up to date (or at least invalidates them accordingly).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At this point, the consumers can get the updated sequence number (8), and because the memory barrier also guarantees the ordering of the instructions that happened before then, the consumers can be confident that all changes the producer did to to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/AbstractEntry.java?spec=svn109&amp;amp;r=201&#34;&gt;Entry&lt;/a&gt; at position 7 are also available.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;hellip;and on the Consumer side?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sequence number on the Consumer is volatile, and read by a number of external objects - other &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html&#34;&gt;downstream&lt;/a&gt; consumers might be tracking this consumer&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html&#34;&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/ProducerBarrier.java?spec=svn109&amp;amp;r=201&#34;&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/RingBuffer.java?spec=svn109&amp;amp;r=242&#34;&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/a&gt; (depending on whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking at older or newer code) tracks it to make sure the the ring doesn&amp;rsquo;t wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qoKYeSC2_OM/Tj7HG5U6RaI/AAAAAAAAIJc/hnLVu3EL-kE/s1600/MemoryBarrierReadExample.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qoKYeSC2_OM/Tj7HG5U6RaI/AAAAAAAAIJc/hnLVu3EL-kE/s1600/MemoryBarrierReadExample.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your downstream consumer (C2) sees that an earlier consumer (C1) reaches number 12, when C2 reads entries up to 12 from the ring buffer it will get all updates C1 made to the entries before it updated its sequence number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically everything that happens after C2 gets the updated sequence number (shown in blue above) must occur after everything C1 did to the ring buffer before updating its sequence number (shown in black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impact on performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memory barriers, being another CPU-level instruction, don&amp;rsquo;t have the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-why-its-so-fast.html&#34;&gt;cost as locks&lt;/a&gt;  - the kernel isn&amp;rsquo;t interfering and arbitrating between multiple threads.  But nothing comes for free.  Memory barriers do have a cost - the compiler/CPU cannot re-order instructions, which could potentially lead to not using the CPU as efficiently as possible, and refreshing the caches obviously has a performance impact.  So don&amp;rsquo;t think that using volatile instead of locking will get you away scot free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the Disruptor implementation tries to read from and write to the sequence number as infrequently as possible.  Every read or write of a &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; field is a relatively costly operation. However, recognising this also plays in quite nicely with batching behaviour - if you know you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t read from or write to the sequences too frequently, it makes sense to grab a whole batch of Entries and process them before updating the sequence number, both on the Producer and Consumer side. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/BatchConsumer.java?r=239&#34;&gt;BatchConsumer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table id=&#34;src_table_0&#34;

keyword.  Using volatile means you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to add locks willy nilly, and will give you performance improvements over using them.  However you need to think a little more carefully about your design, in particular how frequently you use volatile fields, and how frequently you read and write them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Given that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-all-change-please.html&#34;&gt;New World Order&lt;/a&gt; in the Disruptor uses totally different naming conventions now to everything I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about so far, I guess the next post is mapping the old world to the new one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s even &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&amp;rsquo;s blog title&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/RingBuffer.java&#34;&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/a&gt;, and I referred to it in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-why-its-so-fast.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;.  Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&amp;rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comp Sci 101&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I love about working at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; is all that stuff I learnt at university and in my A Level Computing actually means something.  So often as a developer you can get away with not understanding the CPU, data structures or &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation&#34;&gt;Big O notation&lt;/a&gt; - I spent 10 years of my career forgetting all that.  But it turns out that if you do know about these things, and you apply that knowledge, you can come up with some very clever, very fast code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a refresher for those of us who studied this at school, and an intro for those who didn&amp;rsquo;t.  Beware - this post contains massive over-simplifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CPU is the heart of your machine and the thing that ultimately has to do all the operations, executing your program.  Main memory (RAM) is where your data (including the lines of your program) lives.  We&amp;rsquo;re going to ignore stuff like hard drives and networks here because &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; is aimed at running as much as possible in memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CPU has several layers of cache between it and main memory, because even accessing main memory is too slow.  If you&amp;rsquo;re doing the same operation on a piece of data multiple times, it makes sense to load this into a place very close to the CPU when it&amp;rsquo;s performing the operation (think a loop counter - you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be going off to main memory to fetch this to increment it every time you loop around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_rreUS6uUzs/TicrO8neu9I/AAAAAAAAIIs/1GVO_DbXcQo/s1600/CPUCache.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_rreUS6uUzs/TicrO8neu9I/AAAAAAAAIIs/1GVO_DbXcQo/s400/CPUCache.png&#34; width=&#34;298&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closer the cache is to the CPU, the faster it is and the smaller it is.  L1 cache is small and very fast, and right next to the core that uses it.  L2 is bigger and slower, and still only used by a single core.  L3 is more common with modern multi-core machines, and is bigger again, slower again, and shared across cores on a single socket.  Finally you have main memory, which is shared across all cores and all sockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the CPU is performing an operation, it&amp;rsquo;s first going to look in L1 for the data it needs, then L2, then L3, and finally if it&amp;rsquo;s not in any of the caches the data needs to be fetched all the way from main memory.  The further it has to go, the longer the operation will take.  So if you&amp;rsquo;re doing something very frequently, you want to make sure that data is in L1 cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin and Mike&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;QCon presentation&lt;/a&gt; gives some indicative figures for the cost of cache misses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;Latency from CPU to&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;padding-left: 5px;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Main memory&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~60-80ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;QPI transit&lt;br /&gt;(between sockets, not drawn)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~20ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;L3 cache&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~40-45 cycles, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~15ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;L2 cache&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~10 cycles, &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~3ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;L1 cache&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~3-4 cycles,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;~1ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Register&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 cycle&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re aiming for an end-to-end latency of something like 10 milliseconds, an 80 nanosecond trip to main memory to get some missing data is going to take a serious chunk of that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache lines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now the interesting thing to note is that it&amp;rsquo;s not individual items that get stored in the cache - i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s not a single variable, a single pointer.  The cache is made up of cache lines, typically 64 bytes, and it effectively references a location in main memory.  A Java &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; is 8 bytes, so in a single cache line you could have 8 &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--A4eyU2Joec/TicxZW-yQoI/AAAAAAAAIIw/E40PtQOzMfE/s1600/CacheLines.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;301&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--A4eyU2Joec/TicxZW-yQoI/AAAAAAAAIIw/E40PtQOzMfE/s400/CacheLines.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore the multiple cache-levels for simplicity)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;This is brilliant if you&amp;rsquo;re accessing an array of longs - when one value from the array gets loaded into the cache, you get up to 7 more for free.  So you can walk that array very quickly.  In fact, you can iterate over any data structure that is allocated to contiguous blocks in memory very quickly.  I made a passing reference to this in the very &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html&#34;&gt;first post about the ring buffer&lt;/a&gt;, and it explains why we use an array for it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;So if items in your data structure aren&amp;rsquo;t sat next to each other in memory (linked lists, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you) you don&amp;rsquo;t get the advantage of freebie cache loading.  You could be getting a cache miss for every item in that data structure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, there is a drawback to all this free loading.  Imagine your &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t part of an array.  Imagine it&amp;rsquo;s just a single variable.  Let&amp;rsquo;s call it &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;, for no real reason.  Then imagine you have another variable in your class right next to it.  Let&amp;rsquo;s arbitrarily call it &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;.  Now, when you load &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; into your cache, you get &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; for free. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4mwTYGoo99U/Tic141EFSgI/AAAAAAAAII0/Q2Y18D38iN0/s1600/FalseSharing.png&#34;

width=&#34;358&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which sounds fine.  Until you realise that &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; is being written to by your producer, and &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; is being written to by your consumer.  These two variables aren&amp;rsquo;t actually closely associated, and in fact are going to be used by two different threads that might be running on two different cores.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ORwRPsgwzVI/Tic4MDC9SHI/AAAAAAAAII4/1bBv6awjOj0/s1600/FalseSharingWriteHead.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Imagine your consumer updates the value of &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;.  The cache value is updated, the value in memory is updated, and any other cache lines that contain head are invalidated because other caches will not have the shiny new value.  And remember that we deal with the level of the whole line, we can&amp;rsquo;t just mark &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; as being invalid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jPntzX3pGao/Tic6xdP9uXI/AAAAAAAAII8/THPUBZrvgX8/s1600/FalseSharingReadTail.png&#34;

Both cores are going to be invalidating the cache line on the other core and having to re-read it every time the other thread has written to it.  You&amp;rsquo;ve basically got write-contention between the two threads even though they&amp;rsquo;re writing to two different variables.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;This is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing&#34;&gt;false sharing&lt;/a&gt;, because every time you access &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; you get &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt; too, and every time you access &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, you get &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; as well.  All this is happening under the covers, and no compiler warning is going to tell you that you just wrote code that&amp;rsquo;s going to be very inefficient for concurrent access.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our solution - magic cache line padding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see that the Disruptor eliminates this problem, at least for architecture that has a cache size of 64 bytes or less, by adding padding to ensure the ring buffer&amp;rsquo;s sequence number is never in a cache line with anything else.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler has written a &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1736243820&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;really good article&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1736243821&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describing not only &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, but also how it fits into the architecture at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;.  This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &amp;ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working up to answering that.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently on question number two: &amp;ldquo;Why is it so fast?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about why it&amp;rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m trapped in a circular dependency.  A circular dependency of blogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To break the dependency, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer question one with the simplest answer, and with any luck I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to it in a later post if it still needs explanation: the Disruptor is a way to pass information between threads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a developer, already my alarm bells are going off because the word &amp;ldquo;thread&amp;rdquo; was just mentioned, which means this is about concurrency, and Concurrency Is Hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concurrency 101&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine two threads are trying to change the same value. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Case One:&lt;/i&gt; Thread 1 gets there first:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The value changes to &amp;ldquo;blah&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then the value changes to &amp;ldquo;blahy&amp;rdquo; when Thread 2 gets there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Case Two:&lt;/i&gt; Thread 2 gets there first:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The value changes to &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then the value changes to &amp;ldquo;blah&amp;rdquo; when Thread 1 gets there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Case Three:&lt;/i&gt; Thread 1 interrupts Thread 2:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread 2 gets the value &amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo; and stores it as &lt;code&gt;myValue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread 1 goes in and updates value to &amp;ldquo;blah&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then Thread 2 wakes up and sets the value to &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;Case Three is probably the only one which is definitely wrong, unless you think the naive approach to wiki editing is OK (&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Code&lt;/a&gt; Wiki, I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you&amp;hellip;).  In the other two cases it&amp;rsquo;s all about intentions and predictability.  Thread 2 might not care what&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, the intention might be to append &amp;ldquo;y&amp;rdquo; to whatever is in there regardless.  In this circumstance, cases one and two are both correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But if Thread 2 only wanted to change &amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo;, then both cases two and three are incorrect.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Assuming that Thread 2 wants to set the value to &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo;, there are some different approaches to solving the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approach One: Pessimistic locking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Does the &amp;ldquo;No Entry&amp;rdquo; sign make sense to people who don&amp;rsquo;t drive in Britain?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terms pessimistic and optimistic locking seem to be more commonly used when talking about database reads and writes, but the principal applies to getting a lock on an object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thread 2 grabs a lock on &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; as soon as it knows it needs it and stops anything from setting it. Then it does its thing, sets the value, and lets everything else carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can imagine this gets quite expensive, with threads hanging around all over the place trying to get hold of objects and being blocked.  The more threads you have, the more chance that things are going to grind to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Approach Two: Optimistic locking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MC3Zia0u-LI/TiGrA4AEKKI/AAAAAAAAIIo/7q-x9sSJYR4/s1600/ConcurrencyOptimisticLocking.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;252&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MC3Zia0u-LI/TiGrA4AEKKI/AAAAAAAAIIo/7q-x9sSJYR4/s400/ConcurrencyOptimisticLocking.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In this case Thread 2 will only lock &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; when it needs to write to it.  In order to make this work, it needs to check if &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; has changed since it first looked at it.  If Thread 1 came in and changed the value to &amp;ldquo;blah&amp;rdquo; after Thread 2 had read the value, Thread 2 couldn&amp;rsquo;t write &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo; to the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; and trample all over the change from Thread 1.  Thread 2 could either re-try (go back, read the value, and append &amp;ldquo;y&amp;rdquo; onto the end of the new value), which you would do if Thread 2 didn&amp;rsquo;t care what the value it was changing was; or it could throw an exception or return some sort of failed update flag if it was expecting to change &amp;ldquo;fluff&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fluffy&amp;rdquo;.  An example of this latter case might be if you have two users trying to update a Wiki page, and you tell the user on the other end of Thread 2 they&amp;rsquo;ll need to load the new changes from Thread 1 and then reapply their changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Potential Problem: Deadlock&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Locking can lead to all sorts of issues, for example deadlock.  Imagine two threads that need access to two resources to do whatever they need to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sDyHhoLnwxw/Th60id1KUEI/AAAAAAAAIIE/_ru21J5fklI/s1600/ConcurrencyDeadlock.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sDyHhoLnwxw/Th60id1KUEI/AAAAAAAAIIE/_ru21J5fklI/s400/ConcurrencyDeadlock.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve used an over-zealous locking technique, both threads are going to sit there forever waiting for the other one to release its lock on the resource.  That&amp;rsquo;s when you reboot &lt;strike&gt;Windows&lt;/strike&gt; your computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Definite Problem: Locks are sloooow&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about locks is that they need the operating system to arbitrate the argument.  The threads are like siblings squabbling over a toy, and the OS kernel is the parent that decides which one gets it. It&amp;rsquo;s like when you run to your Dad to tell him your sister has nicked the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Transformers-Power-Bots-Optimus-Prime/dp/B003A6CK0O?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&#34;

style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j7wPAJe3YuE/TiFBp0XCn6I/AAAAAAAAIIM/FrketUYEsFY/s1600/ConcurrencyCAS.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;170&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j7wPAJe3YuE/TiFBp0XCn6I/AAAAAAAAIIM/FrketUYEsFY/s320/ConcurrencyCAS.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note this could be two different cores rather than two separate CPUs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAS operations are much cheaper than locks because they don&amp;rsquo;t involve the operating system, they go straight to the CPU.  But they&amp;rsquo;re not cost-free - in the experiment I mentioned above, where a lock-free thread takes 300ms and a thread with a lock takes 10,000ms, a single thread using CAS takes 5,700ms.  So it takes less time than using a lock, but more time than a single thread that doesn&amp;rsquo;t worry about contention at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Disruptor - I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/ClaimStrategy.java&#34;&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/a&gt; when I &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html&#34;&gt;went over the producers&lt;/a&gt;.  In the code you&amp;rsquo;ll see two strategies, a &lt;code&gt;SingleThreadedStrategy&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;MultiThreadedStrategy&lt;/code&gt;.  You could argue, why not just use the multi-threaded one with only a single producer?  Surely it can handle that case?  And it can.  But the multi-threaded one uses an &lt;a href=&#34;http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicLong.html&#34;&gt;AtomicLong&lt;/a&gt; (Java&amp;rsquo;s way of providing CAS operations), and the single-threaded one uses a simple long with no locks and no CAS.  This means the single-threaded claim strategy is as fast as possible, given that it knows there is only one producer and therefore no contention on the sequence number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking: turning one single number into an AtomicLong can&amp;rsquo;t possibly have been the only thing that is the secret to the Disruptor&amp;rsquo;s speed. And of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not - otherwise this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be called &amp;ldquo;Why it&amp;rsquo;s so fast (part &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;)&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is an important point - there&amp;rsquo;s only one place in the code where multiple threads might be trying to update the same value.  Only one place in the whole of this complicated data-structure-slash-framework.  And that&amp;rsquo;s the secret.  Remember everything has its own sequence number?  If you only have one producer then every sequence number in the system is only ever written to by one thread. That means there is no contention.  No need for locks.  No need even for CAS.  The only sequence number that is ever written to by more than one thread is the one on the &lt;code&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/code&gt; if there is more than one producer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also why each variable in the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-wiring-up.html&#34;&gt;can only be written to by one consumer&lt;/a&gt;.  It ensures there&amp;rsquo;s no write contention, therefore no need for locks or CAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back to why queues aren&amp;rsquo;t up to the job&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you start to see why queues, which may implemented as a ring buffer under the covers, still can&amp;rsquo;t match the performance of the Disruptor.  The queue, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer&#34;&gt;basic ring buffer&lt;/a&gt;, only has two pointers - one to the front of the queue and one to the end:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9yewqxZu37M/TiGdFiaCj6I/AAAAAAAAIIU/bF4fxONwB_8/s1600/QueueMultiple.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;130&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9yewqxZu37M/TiGdFiaCj6I/AAAAAAAAIIU/bF4fxONwB_8/s400/QueueMultiple.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If more than one producer wants to place something on the queue, the tail pointer will be a point of contention as more than one thing wants to write to it.  If there&amp;rsquo;s more than one consumer, then the head pointer is contended, because this is not just a read operation but a write, as the pointer is updated when the item is consumed from the queue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, I hear you cry foul!  Because we already knew this, so queues are usually single producer and single consumer (or at least they are in all the queue comparisons in our performance tests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another thing to bear in mind with queues/buffers.  The whole point is to provide a place for things to hang out between producers and consumers, to help buffer bursts of messages from one to the other.  This means the buffer is usually full (the producer is out-pacing the consumer) or empty (the consumer is out-pacing the producer).  It&amp;rsquo;s rare that the producer and consumer will be so evenly-matched that the buffer has items in it but the producers and consumers are keeping pace with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is how things really look.  An empty queue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-lU_Ey7mi4/TiGmx5Ja2jI/AAAAAAAAIIg/gQOZ8f76mLM/s1600/QueueEmpty.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;173&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-lU_Ey7mi4/TiGmx5Ja2jI/AAAAAAAAIIg/gQOZ8f76mLM/s400/QueueEmpty.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hellip;and a full queue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARPMAbYKnoE/TiGm4hgxeDI/AAAAAAAAIIk/xMl4ItVob2U/s1600/QueueFull.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;178&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ARPMAbYKnoE/TiGm4hgxeDI/AAAAAAAAIIk/xMl4ItVob2U/s400/QueueFull.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The queue needs a size so that it can tell the difference between empty and full.  Or, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it might determine that based on the contents of that entry, in which case reading an entry will require a write to erase it or mark it as consumed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whichever implementation is chosen, there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of contention around the tail, head and size variables, or the entry itself if a consume operation also includes a write to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of this, these three variables are often in the same &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache&#34;&gt;cache line&lt;/a&gt;, leading to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing&#34;&gt;false sharing&lt;/a&gt;.  So, not only do you have to worry about the producer and the consumer both causing a write to the size variable (or the entry), updating the tail pointer could lead to a cache-miss when the head pointer is updated because they&amp;rsquo;re sat in the same place.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to duck out of going into that in detail because this post is quite long enough as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is what we mean when we talk about &amp;ldquo;Teasing Apart the Concerns&amp;rdquo; or a queue&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;conflated concerns&amp;rdquo;.  By giving everything its own sequence number and by allowing only one consumer to write to each variable in the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt;, the only case the Disruptor needs to manage contention is where more than one producer is writing to the ring buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Disruptor a number of advantages over traditional approaches:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;No contention = no locks = it&amp;rsquo;s very fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having everything track its own sequence number allows multiple producers and multiple consumers to use the same data structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tracking sequence numbers at each individual place (ring buffer, claim strategy, producers and consumers), plus the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/RingBuffer.java&#34;&gt;magic cache line padding&lt;/a&gt;, means no false sharing and no unexpected contention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;EDIT: Note that version 2.0 of the Disruptor uses different names to the ones in this article.  Please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-all-change-please.html&#34;&gt;my summary of the changes&lt;/a&gt; if you are confused about class names.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_wiring_up_the_dependencies/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;ve covered the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html&#34;&gt;ring buffer&lt;/a&gt; itself, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-how-do-i-read-from.html&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; from it and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control.  I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation.  Multiple consumers can get a little more involved.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt; done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.  Like a lot of applications, we have a pipeline of things that need to happen before we can actually get on with the business logic - for example, we need to make sure the messages have been journalled to disk before we can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://disruptor.googlecode.com/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;Disruptor paper&lt;/a&gt; and the performance tests cover some basic configurations that you might want. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over the most interesting one, mostly because I needed the practice with the graphics tablet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamond configuration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/perf/com/lmax/disruptor/DiamondPath1P3CPerfTest.java&#34;&gt;DiamondPath1P3CPerfTest&lt;/a&gt; illustrates a configuration which is not too uncommon - a single producer with three consumers.  The tricky point being that the third consumer is dependent upon the previous two consumers to finish before it can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-34LTXhqK1wA/ThSvXbNTAjI/AAAAAAAAIFY/qpFZNXWgbPE/s1600/1P3C-Diamond.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;264&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-34LTXhqK1wA/ThSvXbNTAjI/AAAAAAAAIFY/qpFZNXWgbPE/s400/1P3C-Diamond.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consumer three might be your business logic, consumer one could be backing up the data received, and consumer two may be preparing the data or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamond configuration using queues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theserverside.com/news/1363672/Building-a-Scalable-Enterprise-Applications-Using-Asynchronous-IO-and-SEDA-Model&#34;&gt;SEDA-style architecture&lt;/a&gt;, each stage will be separated by a queue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Di1CzgcZR0/ThSzSdp1sTI/AAAAAAAAIFc/9mhK_7hLBdk/s1600/1P3C-Diamond-Queue.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;263&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Di1CzgcZR0/ThSzSdp1sTI/AAAAAAAAIFc/9mhK_7hLBdk/s400/1P3C-Diamond-Queue.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Why does queue have to have so many &amp;ldquo;e&amp;quot;s?  It&amp;rsquo;s the letter I have the most trouble with in these drawings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might get an inkling of the problem here: for a message to get from P1 to C3 it has to travel through four whole queues, each queue taking its cost in terms of putting the message on the queue and taking it off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diamond configuration using the Disruptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; world, it&amp;rsquo;s all managed on a single ring buffer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fGp-zkgVWs0/ThnC8m1O8bI/AAAAAAAAIHI/jUZJ6Xos608/s1600/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;359&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fGp-zkgVWs0/ThnC8m1O8bI/AAAAAAAAIHI/jUZJ6Xos608/s640/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It does look more complicated.  But the ring buffer remains the single point of contact between all the players, and the interactions are all based on the barriers checking the sequence numbers of the things it&amp;rsquo;s dependent upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The producer side is fairly simple, it&amp;rsquo;s the single producer model described in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/07/dissecting-disruptor-writing-to-ring.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the producer barrier doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to care about all the consumers.  It only cares about consumer three, because if consumer three has finished with an item in the ring buffer the other two will already have processed it.  So if C3 has moved on, that slot in the ring buffer is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To manage the dependencies between the consumers you need two consumer barriers.  The first just talks to the ring buffer and consumers one and two ask it for the next available item.  The second consumer barrier knows about consumers one and two, and it will return the lowest sequence number processed by both consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How consumer dependencies work in the Disruptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm.  I can see I&amp;rsquo;m going to need an example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CDUq8tbkg5U/ThTBcrHD_wI/AAAAAAAAIFo/edukW6dAG5Q/s1600/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer-Example.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;294&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CDUq8tbkg5U/ThTBcrHD_wI/AAAAAAAAIFo/edukW6dAG5Q/s640/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer-Example.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re joining the party halfway through the story: the producer has filled the ring buffer up to sequence number 22; consumer one has read and processed everything up to 21; consumer two has processed everything up to sequence 18; consumer three, which is dependent upon the other consumers, has only made it as far as 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producer can&amp;rsquo;t write anything more to the ring buffer because sequence 15 is taking up the slot where we&amp;rsquo;d want to put sequence 23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PKLturGyJac/ThnEt30SVLI/AAAAAAAAIHM/8w-q90sErcY/s1600/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer-Example2.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;314&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PKLturGyJac/ThnEt30SVLI/AAAAAAAAIHM/8w-q90sErcY/s640/1P3C-Diamond-RingBuffer-Example2.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I really did try to find an alternative to red and green, but everything else was just as ambiguous).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first consumer barrier lets consumers one and two know they can grab anything up to sequence 22, the highest sequence number in the ring buffer.  The second consumer barrier checks the ring buffer sequence, but it also checks the sequences on the other two consumers and returns the lowest value.  So consumer three is told it can get anything up to sequence 18 from the ring buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the consumers are still reading the entries directly from the ring buffer - consumers one and two are not taking the entries off the ring buffer and then passing them on to consumer three.  Instead, the second consumer barrier is letting consumer three know which entry in the ring buffer it&amp;rsquo;s safe to process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This raises a question - if everything comes directly off the ring buffer, how is consumer three going to find out about anything the first two consumers have done?  If all consumer three cares about is that the earlier consumers have done their job (e.g. replicating the data to somewhere else) then everything&amp;rsquo;s fine - when consumer three is told the job is done, it&amp;rsquo;s happy.  If, however, consumer three needs the results of an earlier consumer&amp;rsquo;s processing, where does it get that from?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modifying entries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is to write them to the ring buffer &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; itself.  This way, when consumer three grabs the entry off the ring buffer, it will have been populated with all the information consumer three needs to do the job.  The really important part of this is that for each field on the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; only one consumer is allowed to write to it.  This prevents any write-contention which will slow the whole thing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C26vt5NZaFo/ThnI4LpUzdI/AAAAAAAAIHU/I_9vAzu8EQY/s1600/FizzBuzzEntry.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;215&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C26vt5NZaFo/ThnI4LpUzdI/AAAAAAAAIHU/I_9vAzu8EQY/s400/FizzBuzzEntry.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see this in &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/perf/com/lmax/disruptor/DiamondPath1P3CPerfTest.java&#34;&gt;DiamondPath1P3CPerfTest&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/perf/com/lmax/disruptor/support/FizzBuzzEntry.java&#34;&gt;FizzBuzzEntry&lt;/a&gt; has two fields as well as the value: &lt;code&gt;fizz&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;buzz&lt;/code&gt;.  If the consumer is a Fizz consumer, it writes to &lt;code&gt;fizz&lt;/code&gt;.  If it&amp;rsquo;s a Buzz consumer, it writes to &lt;code&gt;buzz&lt;/code&gt;.  The third consumer, FizzBuzz, will read both of these fields but not write to either, since reading is fine and won&amp;rsquo;t cause contention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some actual Java code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this looks more complicated than the queue implementation.  And yes, it does involve a bit more coordination.  But this is hidden from the consumers and producers, they just talk to the barriers.  The trick is in the configuration.  The diamond graph in the example above would be created using something like the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ConsumerBarrier consumerBarrier1 = ringBuffer.createConsumerBarrier();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BatchConsumer consumer1 = new BatchConsumer(consumerBarrier1, handler1);&lt;br /&gt;BatchConsumer consumer2 = new BatchConsumer(consumerBarrier1, handler2);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ConsumerBarrier consumerBarrier2 = &lt;br /&gt;    ringBuffer.createConsumerBarrier(consumer1, consumer2);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BatchConsumer consumer3 = new BatchConsumer(consumerBarrier2, handler3);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ProducerBarrier producerBarrier = &lt;br /&gt;    ringBuffer.createProducerBarrier(consumer3);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it - how to wire up the Disruptor with multiple consumers that are dependent on each other.  The key points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use multiple consumer barriers to manage dependencies between consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have the producer barrier watch the last consumer in the graph.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow only one consumer to write to an individual field in an &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;EDIT: Adrian has &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symphonious.net/2011/07/11/lmax-disruptor-high-performance-low-latency-and-simple-too/&#34;&gt;written a nice DSL&lt;/a&gt; to make wiring up the Disruptor much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 2: Note that version 2.0 of the Disruptor uses different names to the ones in this article.  Please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-all-change-please.html&#34;&gt;my summary of the changes&lt;/a&gt; if you are confused about class names.  Also Adrian&amp;rsquo;s DSL is now part of the main Disruptor code base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &amp;nbsp;Brace yourselves, it&#39;s quite long. &amp;nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ProducerBarriers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor code&lt;/a&gt; has interfaces and helper classes for the &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;s, but there&#39;s no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s because nothing else needs to access your producer, only you need to know about it. &amp;nbsp;However, like the consuming side, a &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; is created by the ring buffer and your producer will use this to write to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing to the ring buffer involves a two-phase commit. &amp;nbsp;First, your producer has to claim the next slot on the buffer. &amp;nbsp;Then, when the producer has finished writing to the slot, it will call &lt;code&gt;commit&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s look at the first bit. &amp;nbsp;It sounds easy - &#34;get me the next slot on the ring buffer&#34;. &amp;nbsp;Well, from your producer&#39;s point of view it is easy. &amp;nbsp;You simply call &lt;code&gt;nextEntry()&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This will return you an &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; object which is basically the next slot in the ring buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ProducerBarrier makes sure the ring buffer doesn&#39;t wrap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the covers, the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; is doing all the negotiation to figure out what the next slot is, and if you&#39;re allowed to write to it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YOp3ahmnRLw/ThCPQmuS2gI/AAAAAAAAIE0/oI-w-1l2RJc/s1600/PreventRingFromWrapping.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;231&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YOp3ahmnRLw/ThCPQmuS2gI/AAAAAAAAIE0/oI-w-1l2RJc/s640/PreventRingFromWrapping.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#39;m not convinced the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Wacom-CTL460-Bamboo-Pen-Tablet/dp/B002OOWC3I?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=trissramb-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shiny new graphics tablet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=trissramb-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B002OOWC3I&#34; style=&#34;border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; /&gt; is helping the clarity of my pictures, but it&#39;s  fun to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this illustration, we&#39;re going to assume there&#39;s only one producer writing to the ring buffer. &amp;nbsp;We will deal with the intricacies of multiple producers later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ConsumerTrackingProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; has a list of all the &lt;code&gt;Consumers&lt;/code&gt; that are accessing the ring buffer. &amp;nbsp;Now to me this seemed a bit odd - I wouldn&#39;t expect the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; to know anything about the consuming side.  But wait, there is a reason. &amp;nbsp;Because we don&#39;t want the &#34;conflation of concerns&#34; a queue has (it has to track the head and tail which are sometimes the same point), our consumers are responsible for knowing which sequence number they&#39;re up to, not the ring buffer. &amp;nbsp;So, if we want to make sure we don&#39;t wrap the buffer, we need to check where the consumers have got to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the diagram above, one &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is happily at the same point as the highest sequence number (12, highlighted in red/pink). The second &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is a bit behind - maybe it&#39;s doing I/O operations or something - and it&#39;s at sequence number 3. &amp;nbsp;Therefore consumer 2 has the whole length of the buffer to go before it catches up with consumer 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The producer wants to write to the slot on the ring buffer currently occupied by sequence 3, because this slot is the one after the current ring buffer cursor. &amp;nbsp;But the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; knows it can&#39;t write here because a &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is using it. &amp;nbsp;So the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; sits and spins, waiting, until the consumers move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Claiming the next slot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine consumer 2 has finished that batch of entries, and moves its sequence number on. Maybe it got as far as sequence 9 (in real life I expect it will make it as far as 12 because of the way consumer batching works, but that doesn&#39;t make the example as interesting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IxEJ_Dy6_RU/ThCVQIwgLoI/AAAAAAAAIE4/-z4AsZD5nVg/s1600/ProducerNextEntry.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;236&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IxEJ_Dy6_RU/ThCVQIwgLoI/AAAAAAAAIE4/-z4AsZD5nVg/s640/ProducerNextEntry.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diagram above shows what happens when consumer 2 updates to sequence number 9. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve slimmed down the &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; in this picture because it takes no active part in this scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; sees that the next slot, the one that had sequence number 3, is now available. &amp;nbsp;It grabs the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; that sits in this slot (I&#39;ve not talked specifically about the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; class, but it&#39;s basically a bucket for stuff you want to put into the ring buffer slot which has a sequence number), sets the sequence number on the &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; to the next sequence number (13) and returns this entry to your producer. &amp;nbsp;The producer can then write whatever value it wants into this &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Committing the new value&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second phase of the two-stage commit is, well, the commit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vBm6k86SO4k/ThCm5GgkhEI/AAAAAAAAIFA/dB-9NNz47qw/s1600/ProducerCommit.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;224&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vBm6k86SO4k/ThCm5GgkhEI/AAAAAAAAIFA/dB-9NNz47qw/s640/ProducerCommit.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green represents our newly updated &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; with sequence 13 - yeah, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m red-green colour-blind too. &amp;nbsp;But other colours were even more rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the producer has finished writing stuff into the entry it tells the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; to commit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; waits for the ring buffer cursor to catch up to where we are (for a single producer this will always be a bit pointless - e.g. we know the cursor is already at 12, nothing else is writing to the ring buffer). &amp;nbsp;Then the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; updates the ring buffer cursor to the sequence number on the updated &lt;code&gt;Entry&lt;/code&gt; - 13 in our case. &amp;nbsp;Next, the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; lets the consumers know there&#39;s something new in the buffer. &amp;nbsp;It does this by poking the &lt;code&gt;WaitStrategy&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; - &#34;Oi, wake up! Something happened!&#34; (note - different &lt;code&gt;WaitStrategy&lt;/code&gt; implementations deal with this in different ways, depending upon whether it&#39;s blocking or not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now consumer 1 can get entry 13, consumer 2 can get everything up to and including 13, and they all live happily ever after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ProducerBarrier batching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly the disruptor can batch on the producer side as well as &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-how-do-i-read-from.html&#34;&gt;on the Consumer side&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Remember when consumer 2 finally got with the programme and found itself at sequence 9? &amp;nbsp;There is a very cunning thing the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; can do here - it knows the size of the buffer, and it knows where the slowest &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is. &amp;nbsp;So it can figure out which slots are now available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-781DHcbmG2g/ThCXT2xo0xI/AAAAAAAAIE8/5Gls4znj3zw/s1600/ProducerBatching.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em;

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; knows the ring buffer cursor is at 12, and the slowest &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is at 9, it can let producers write to slots 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 before it needs to check where the consumers are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multiple producers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You thought I was done, but there&#39;s more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slightly lied in some of the above drawings. &amp;nbsp;I implied that the sequence number the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; deals with comes directly from the ring buffer&#39;s cursor. &amp;nbsp;However, if you look at the code you&#39;ll see that it uses the &lt;code&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/code&gt; to get this. &amp;nbsp;I skipped this to simplify the diagrams, it&#39;s not so important in the single-producer case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With multiple producers, you need yet another thing tracking a sequence number. &amp;nbsp;This is the sequence that is available for writing to. &amp;nbsp;Note that this is not the same as ring-buffer-cursor-plus-one - if you have more than one producer writing to the buffer, it&#39;s possible there are entries in the process of being written that haven&#39;t been committed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xPQJAkN7lgg/ThC8FGgosdI/AAAAAAAAIFE/qZO9xuiKFPY/s1600/ProducersNextEntry.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s revisit claiming a slot. &amp;nbsp;Each producer asks the &lt;code&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/code&gt; for the next available slot. &amp;nbsp;Producer 1 gets sequence 13, like in the single producer case above. &amp;nbsp;Producer 2 gets sequence 14, even though the ring buffer cursor is still only pointing to 12, because the &lt;code&gt;ClaimSequence&lt;/code&gt; is dishing out the numbers and has been keeping track of what&#39;s been allocated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So each producer has its own slot with a shiny new sequence number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m going colour producer 1 and its slot in green, and producer 2 and its slot in a suspiciously pink-looking purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4bSeLcewe-Q/ThDCM1rWOyI/AAAAAAAAIFQ/cF_dPHKNm-I/s1600/ProducersCommit.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4bSeLcewe-Q/ThDCM1rWOyI/AAAAAAAAIFQ/cF_dPHKNm-I/s1600/ProducersCommit.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: -webkit-auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Now imaging producer 1 is away with the fairies, and hasn&#39;t got around to committing for whatever reason. &amp;nbsp;Producer 2 is ready to commit, and asks the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; to do so.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As we saw in the earlier commit diagram, the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; is only going to commit when the ring buffer cursor reaches the slot behind the one it wants to commit into. &amp;nbsp;In this case, the cursor needs to reach 13 so that we can commit 14. &amp;nbsp;But we can&#39;t, because producer 1 is staring at something shiny and hasn&#39;t committed yet. &amp;nbsp;So the &lt;code&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/code&gt; sits there spinning until the ring buffer cursor gets to where it should be.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2kzqD61cJNU/ThDEYBSFOkI/AAAAAAAAIFU/WY0m9sn5y-w/s1600/ProducersCommit2.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;204&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2kzqD61cJNU/ThDEYBSFOkI/AAAAAAAAIFU/WY0m9sn5y-w/s640/ProducersCommit2.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now producer 1 wakes up from its coma and asks to commit entry 13 (green arrows are sparked by the request from producer 1). &amp;nbsp;The &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; tells the &lt;code&gt;ClaimStrategy&lt;/code&gt; to wait for the ring buffer cursor to get to 12, which it already had of course. &amp;nbsp;So the ring buffer cursor is incremented to 13, and the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; pokes the &lt;code&gt;WaitStrategy&lt;/code&gt; to let everything know the ring buffer was updated. &amp;nbsp;Now the &lt;code&gt;ProducerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; can finish the request from producer 2, increment the ring buffer cursor to 14, and let everyone know that we&#39;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll see that the ring buffer retains the ordering implied by the order of the initial &lt;code&gt;nextEntry()&lt;/code&gt; calls, even if the producers finish writing at different times. &amp;nbsp;It also means that if a producer is causing a pause in writing to the ring buffer, when it unblocks any other pending commits can happen immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phew. &amp;nbsp;And I managed to describe all that without mentioning a memory barrier once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The next in the series of understanding &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;the Disruptor pattern&lt;/a&gt; developed at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are.  Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&amp;rsquo;re using the Disruptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;ConsumerBarriers and Consumers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run.  Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XfVLYjAqNeY/TgjrImkZ-BI/AAAAAAAAIEg/_SM2EqIgATs/s1600/ConsumerWaitFor.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XfVLYjAqNeY/TgjrImkZ-BI/AAAAAAAAIEg/_SM2EqIgATs/s640/ConsumerWaitFor.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(OK, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to regret using Paint/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gimp.org/&#34;&gt;Gimp&lt;/a&gt;.  Although it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent excuse to purchase a graphics tablet if I do continue down this road.  Also UML gurus are probably cursing my name right now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is the thread that wants to get something off the buffer.  It has access to a &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt;, which is created by the &lt;code&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/code&gt; and interacts with it on behalf of the &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;.  While the ring buffer obviously needs a sequence number to figure out what the next available slot is, the consumer also needs to know which sequence number it&amp;rsquo;s up to - each consumer needs to be able to figure out which sequence number it&amp;rsquo;s expecting to see next.  So in the case above, the consumer has dealt with everything in the ring buffer up to and including 8, so it&amp;rsquo;s expecting to see 9 next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consumer calls &lt;code&gt;waitFor&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; with the sequence number it wants next&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code style=&#34;font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;    final long availableSeq = consumerBarrier.waitFor(nextSequence);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; returns the highest sequence number available in the ring buffer - in the example above, 12.  The &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;WaitStrategy&lt;/code&gt; which it uses to decide how to wait for this sequence number - I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details of that right now, the code has comments in outlining the advantages and disadvantages of each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now what?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the consumer has been hanging around waiting for more stuff to get written to the ring buffer, and it&amp;rsquo;s been told what has been written - entries 9, 10, 11 and 12.  Now they&amp;rsquo;re there, the consumer can ask the &lt;code&gt;ConsumerBarrier&lt;/code&gt; to fetch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NKI4nQgA_Co/TgjsGRyaTWI/AAAAAAAAIEk/S7fAyNrjlXQ/s1600/ConsumerRequest.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;222&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NKI4nQgA_Co/TgjsGRyaTWI/AAAAAAAAIEk/S7fAyNrjlXQ/s640/ConsumerRequest.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it&amp;rsquo;s fetching them, the &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; is updating its own cursor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should start to get a feel for how this helps to smooth latency spikes - instead of asking &amp;ldquo;Can I have the next one yet?  How about now?  Now?&amp;rdquo; for every individual item, the &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt; simply says &amp;ldquo;Let me know when you&amp;rsquo;ve got more than this number&amp;rdquo;, and is told in return how many more entries it can grab.  Because these new entries have definitely been written (the ring buffer&amp;rsquo;s sequence has been updated), and because the only things trying to get to these entries can only read them and not write to them, this can be done without locks.  Which is nice.  Not only is it safer and easier to code against, it&amp;rsquo;s much faster not to use a lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the added bonus - you can have multiple &lt;code&gt;Consumers&lt;/code&gt; reading off the same &lt;code&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/code&gt;, with no need for locks and no need for additional queues to coordinate between the different threads.  So you can really run your processing in parallel with the Disruptor coordinating the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/BatchConsumer.java&#34;&gt;BatchConsumer&lt;/a&gt; is an example of consumer code, and if you implement the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/source/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/BatchHandler.java&#34;&gt;BatchHandler &lt;/a&gt;you can get the &lt;code&gt;BatchConsumer&lt;/code&gt; to do the heavy lifting I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined above.  Then it&amp;rsquo;s easy to deal with the whole batch of entries processed (e.g. from 9-12 above) without having to fetch each one individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Note that version 2.0 of the Disruptor uses different names to the ones in this article.  Please see &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-all-change-please.html&#34;&gt;my summary of the changes&lt;/a&gt; if you are confused about class names.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we open sourced the &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;LMAX Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, the key to what makes our exchange so fast.  Why did we open source it?  Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&amp;hellip; a bit wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world.  Plus it makes us look dead clever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the site you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;download a technical article&lt;/a&gt; explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&amp;rsquo;s so clever and fast.  I even get a writing credit on it, which is gratifying when all I really did is insert commas and re-phrase sentences I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I find the whole thing a bit much to digest all at once, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain it in smaller pieces, as suits my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html&#34;&gt;NADD&lt;/a&gt; audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up - the ring buffer.  Initially I was under the impression the Disruptor was just the ring buffer.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that while this data structure is at the heart of the pattern, the clever bit about the Disruptor is controlling access to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What on earth is a ring buffer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does what it says on the tin - it&amp;rsquo;s a ring (it&amp;rsquo;s circular and wraps), and you use it as a buffer to pass stuff from one context (one thread) to another:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gtuTbWgI-Y/TgD92AhOVxI/AAAAAAAAIDE/cWsAT81B0AI/s1600/RingBuffer.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gtuTbWgI-Y/TgD92AhOVxI/AAAAAAAAIDE/cWsAT81B0AI/s1600/RingBuffer.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(OK, I drew it in Paint.  I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with sketch styles and hoping my OCD doesn&amp;rsquo;t kick in and demand perfect circles and straight lines at precise angles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically it&amp;rsquo;s an array with a pointer to the next available slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WCm0iWYOrfc/TgD_cVBQExI/AAAAAAAAIDI/cEohveH8LP8/s1600/RingBufferInitial.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WCm0iWYOrfc/TgD_cVBQExI/AAAAAAAAIDI/cEohveH8LP8/s1600/RingBufferInitial.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you keep filling up the buffer (and presumable reading from it too), the sequence keeps incrementing, wrapping around the ring:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cwPlKupFfks/TgEBetHtvmI/AAAAAAAAIDM/prOjrOPDo_E/s1600/RingBufferWrapped.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cwPlKupFfks/TgEBetHtvmI/AAAAAAAAIDM/prOjrOPDo_E/s1600/RingBufferWrapped.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To find the slot in the array that the current sequence points to you use a mod operation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;padding: 5px;&#34;&gt;sequence mod array length = array index&lt;/blockquote&gt;So for the above ring buffer (using Java mod syntax): &lt;code&gt;12 % 10 = 2&lt;/code&gt;.  Easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually it was a total accident that the picture had ten slots.  Powers of two work better because computers think in binary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;So what?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s entry on &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer&#34;&gt;Circular Buffers&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll see one major difference to the way we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented ours - we don&amp;rsquo;t have a pointer to the end.  We only have the next available sequence number.  This is deliberate - the original reason we chose a ring buffer was so we could support reliable messaging.  We needed a store of the messages the service had sent, so when another service sent a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nak&#34;&gt;nak&lt;/a&gt; to say they hadn&amp;rsquo;t received some messages, it would be able to resend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ring buffer seems ideal for this.  It stores the sequence to show where the end of the buffer is, and if it gets a nak it can replay everything from that point to the current sequence:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r054oYKWMAM/TgHWQjn-zTI/AAAAAAAAIEM/jH73U5AChvA/s1600/RingBufferReplay.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;149&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r054oYKWMAM/TgHWQjn-zTI/AAAAAAAAIEM/jH73U5AChvA/s320/RingBufferReplay.png&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the ring buffer as we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented it, and the queues we had traditionally been using, is that we don&amp;rsquo;t consume the items in the buffer - they stay there until they get over-written.  Which is why we don&amp;rsquo;t need the &amp;ldquo;end&amp;rdquo; pointer you see in the Wikipedia version.  Deciding whether it&amp;rsquo;s OK to wrap or not is managed outside of the data structure itself (this is part of the producer and consumer behaviour - if you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for me to get round to blogging about it, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor site&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s so great because&amp;hellip;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we use this data structure because it gives us some nice behaviour for reliable messaging.  It turns out though that it has some other nice characteristics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s faster than something like a linked list because it&amp;rsquo;s an array, and has a predictable pattern of access.  This is nice and CPU-cache-friendly - at the hardware level the entries can be pre-loaded, so the machine is not constantly going back to main memory to load the next item in the ring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it&amp;rsquo;s an array and you can pre-allocate it up front, making the objects effectively immortal.  This means the garbage collector has pretty much nothing to do here.  Again, unlike a linked list which creates objects for every item added to the list - these then all need to be cleaned up when the item is no longer in the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The missing pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t talked about how to prevent the ring wrapping, or specifics around how to write stuff to and read things from the ring buffer.  You&amp;rsquo;ll also notice I&amp;rsquo;ve been comparing it to a data structure like a linked list, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone believes is the answer to the world&amp;rsquo;s problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting part comes when you compare the Disruptor with an implementation like a queue.  Queues usually take care of all the stuff like the start and end of the queue, adding and consuming items, and so forth.  All the stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t really touched on with the ring buffer.  That&amp;rsquo;s because the ring buffer itself isn&amp;rsquo;t responsible for these things, we&amp;rsquo;ve moved these concerns outside of the data structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details you&amp;rsquo;re just going to have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/&#34;&gt;read the paper or check out the code&lt;/a&gt;.  Or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;watch Mike and Martin&lt;/a&gt; at QCon San Francisco last year.  Or wait for me to have a spare five minutes to get my head around the rest of it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/stac_london_summit/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday I tagged along to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stacresearch.com/node/8970&#34;&gt;STAC London Summit&lt;/a&gt; to provide backup for &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, who was on the &amp;ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&amp;rdquo; panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NRHoNyOb8Bs/TfUO0FswkoI/AAAAAAAAICw/PaFNJkS6sEU/s1600/IMG_20110608_162250.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NRHoNyOb8Bs/TfUO0FswkoI/AAAAAAAAICw/PaFNJkS6sEU/s320/IMG_20110608_162250.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo;, Citihub and &lt;a href=&#34;http://community.lmaxtrader.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;.    Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches. Which one you adopt is likely to be influenced by how your team work and the hardware you have (or can obtain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Mike touched on how we as developers need to do more than simply rely on fast messaging to provide our high performance.  At LMAX, we keep banging on about mechanical sympathy and clean, well designed code to make sure we make the most of the infrastructure.  He also got a dig in at &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Ecommerce/jms/index.html&#34;&gt;JMS&lt;/a&gt;, which I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone disagreed with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The main point I took away, however, is that although speed is very important in ultra high performance trading (of course), control is becoming almost more important: specifically configuration and monitoring.  Because it&amp;rsquo;s all well and good having a super-fast messaging infrastructure, but if you can&amp;rsquo;t get it to do what you want, or you can&amp;rsquo;t see what it&amp;rsquo;s doing, where the bottlenecks are, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re using it properly, it&amp;rsquo;s a massive waste of cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout later presentations and panels, and some chat afterwards, I picked up the configuration/monitoring theme a few more times.  Fast is one thing, high availability is another, which should not be ignored simply for speed of execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else I heard a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; is how Java is totally unsuitable for high performance systems.  Well&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;d like to disprove that.  I guess we need need to get out there and start talking about why this is a myth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the event actually.  It was such a contrast to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/04/tradetech-2011-not-like-developer.html&#34;&gt;TradeTech&lt;/a&gt;, which was all vendors and boys in suits who couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get to the pub.  This summit hit our sweet spot - technology and trading.  The presentations were aimed at people with both deep technical knowledge and a clear understanding of the business domain.  It was somewhere we could talk quite comfortably about what we do, with a good mix of attendees who were seriously interested in the field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I particularly liked was how the vendor pitches were kept to lightning talks - five minutes per pitch.  This was an excellent idea.  You got enough of a flavour to decide to find out more if it looked like something useful, but not so much you were bored or felt sold to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event was also a really good size, it seemed to encourage networking and chatting.  People mingled more easily than at any of the other events I&amp;rsquo;ve been to recently, and not necessarily because they already knew each other.  Mike and I were approached by a lot of people who were either curious to find out what LMAX did, or had already heard of us through some other channel.  I even gave out a bunch of business cards, which finally justified the long, hard battle I had getting them (&amp;ldquo;Developers don&amp;rsquo;t need business cards&amp;rdquo; apparently - but what if I meet a cute guy?  How am I supposed to give him my number?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment was not delivering on promises. The agenda &lt;i&gt;distinctly &lt;/i&gt;mentions cocktails.  But instead there was simply wine and beer.  I forgave them because the wine was decent and there was plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I was impressed and definitely want to go to more of these events. We&amp;rsquo;d love to get more involved at presenting at some too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why Java developers hate .NET</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/why_java_developers_hate_net/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been struggling with .NET.  Actually, I have been fighting pitched battles with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#.  Easy, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trisha&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#&lt;/h3&gt;Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward.  Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Find-and-replace the following (only you can&amp;rsquo;t use Ctrl+R like I expect.  Sigh.)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;line-height: 16px; size: 10px;&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;readonly&lt;/code&gt; (but remove from method params)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.out.printf&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;Console.WriteLine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip; oh.  I have no idea. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. When using callbacks, replace anonymous inner classes with delegates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;something.doSomething(new SomethingRequest(),&lt;br /&gt;  new SomethingCallBack()&lt;br /&gt;  {&lt;br /&gt;    public void onSuccess()&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;      System.out.println(&amp;ldquo;Action successful&amp;rdquo;);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;    public void onFailure()&lt;br /&gt;    {&lt;br /&gt;      System.err.println(&amp;ldquo;Action failed&amp;rdquo;);&lt;br /&gt;    }&lt;br /&gt;  });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;C#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private void foo ()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  _something.DoSomething(new SomethingRequest(), &lt;br /&gt;                         SomethingSuccess, &lt;br /&gt;                         SomethingFailure);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;private void SomethingSuccess()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  Console.WriteLine(&amp;ldquo;Action successful&amp;rdquo;);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;private void SomethingFailure()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  Console.Error.WriteLine(&amp;ldquo;Action failed&amp;rdquo;);&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather like this pattern actually.  You can&amp;rsquo;t really tell in the noddy example above, but the C# code is generally shorter and more reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Replace getters and setters with properties&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;private class MyClass&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  private BigDecimal myField = new BigDecimal(&amp;quot;-1.0&amp;rdquo;);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  public BigDecimal getMyField()&lt;br /&gt;  {&lt;br /&gt;    return myField;&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  public void setMyField(BigDecimal instructionId)&lt;br /&gt;  {&lt;br /&gt;    this.myField = myField&lt;br /&gt;  }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;C#&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal class MyClass&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;  public decimal MyField{ get; set; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the&amp;hellip; where did all my code go??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with the language.  In general, for what I was doing, the equivalent C# was a lot less code.  The fact that the syntax is not wildly different from Java made the transition relatively easy, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t get all the nuances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the enums - I can see what purpose they serve, but I quite like the way the Java ones are pretty much classes in their own right with properties of their own - it allows you to encapsulate some of your simplest domain objects.  But it&amp;rsquo;s a minor point, not a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The C# capitalisation makes me queasy though.  I just can&amp;rsquo;t get my head around it.  In Java, if I say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;com.mechanitis.foo.Bar&lt;/pre&gt;I know the class is Bar and the rest is the package (or namespace, or whatever).  This is more useful when you&amp;rsquo;re using static methods and so forth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;com.mechanitis.foo.Bar.thatThingIWantToDo()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In C#, I know the thing at the end is a method and the thing before that is a class, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t jump out at me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Com.Mechanitis.Foo.Bar.ThatThingIWantToDo();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;re using a property:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Com.Mechanitis.Foo.Bar.MyProperty;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing makes me dizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could argue that all this is redundant with modern tools and IDEs doing all the heavy lifting for you - nice colourisation etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to The Rant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oh My Dear God What Is Wrong With Visual Studio?&lt;/h3&gt;C# needs to be a shorter, more succinct language because it takes &lt;i&gt;three billion times longer&lt;/i&gt; to do anything in Visual bloody Studio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m coming at this from a Java, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ &lt;/a&gt;point of view, so there&amp;rsquo;s always the possibility it might be lack of familiarity with the tool, rather than the tool itself, which is the problem.  It&amp;rsquo;s a long time since I used VS, and that was back in the 90s when I was doing ASP and COM (shhh, don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But things shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this hard.  I was ready to accept, due to my newbie status, the IDE not helping me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to actively hinder me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example: it took hours of my life that I will never get back to discover that you can&amp;rsquo;t simply run a class that has a main method by right-clicking and selecting &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; (note: I&amp;rsquo;m not even trying Ctrl+F10).  No.  I have to select, at a Solution level, which Projects are runnable.  Then I have to select at the Project level the class with the main method I actually want to run.  Then, it opens up a terminal window and runs it in there, which promptly disappears when the program errors or finishes.  What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with outputting in the output window of the IDE? Is that not what it&amp;rsquo;s for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I worked out how to run the cursed program (seriously, like that&amp;rsquo;s not the first thing everyone wants to do?  How do people write &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;?).  Now, where are the command line arguments?  Of course, they&amp;rsquo;re at the project properties level too, because each project only has one entry point.  I seriously had to Google that too because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t work it out from the IDE alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/&#34;&gt;ReSharper &lt;/a&gt;licence had expired.  I decided I should attempt to limp on without it, after all hundreds of developers must be surviving with just Visual Studio.  How bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very bad, it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those helpful little squiggles I was leaning heavily on to convert my Java to C#?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The red to tell you you&amp;rsquo;re utterly wrong.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The orange to tell you could be using less code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The blue to remind you to stop thinking in Java and helpfully offer corrected naming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The green to suggest stuff that C# could do differently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do people code like this?  Do they really just do a build to check if it&amp;rsquo;s all wrong or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I try to find a class.  I actually have no idea how to do this, because I can&amp;rsquo;t use Ctrl+N.  So I Ctrl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realise this is a waste of time anyway, because one thing that &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; annoys me about Visual Studio is that I can&amp;rsquo;t find a way to sync the project tree to the class file I&amp;rsquo;m looking at.  I can&amp;rsquo;t get it to jump to highlight where I am.  When I&amp;rsquo;m using IntelliJ, I find this dead useful when I want to see other stuff in the same package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than ten minutes after attempting to use Visual Studio without ReSharper, I&amp;rsquo;ve abandoned the fight and tracked down a licence and installed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Documentation isn&amp;rsquo;t a standard function of .NET?&lt;/h3&gt;What sort of message does this give developers?  Documentation isn&amp;rsquo;t important?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought Javadoc was pretty ugly and clunky. In addition, now our IDEs generate so much, it&amp;rsquo;s frequently meaningless.  But it is generated by standard Java tools, and HTML is a standard format that can be read on pretty much any computer with any operating system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe how hard it was to get the XML comments out of the C# into something the user can actually read.  Thank goodness, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.symphonious.net/&#34;&gt;some enterprising member of the team&lt;/a&gt; had already done that for us.  All I needed to do was hack/crowbar the tutorial I&amp;rsquo;d been working on into the generated documentation, so it ended up in the Windows help files in some fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there&amp;rsquo;s a way to get HTML/XML files into the end result using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;Sandcastle&lt;/a&gt;, but hours of Googling only told me it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; possible, not how to do it.  I still have no idea what the correct question is to ask to find the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, this is an unsolved mystery.  Our .NET client users will have to read the plain HTML I&amp;rsquo;m afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;Are we lowly Java developers spoilt with our shiny IDEs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or is there such a fundamentally different approach to development for .NET people that all the functionality is there, I just can&amp;rsquo;t find it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed if I&amp;rsquo;m honest.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure the .NET camp used to tout their tools as their superiority.  I ended up feeling sorry for the poor NET people.  Is there anything they can use that isn&amp;rsquo;t Visual Studio?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Conclusion: Despite the nasty capitalisation I found myself surprisingly taken with C#.  But until they can give me a proper development environment, I won&amp;rsquo;t be tempted by the dark side any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As an associate member of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; (LJC), I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://jcp.org/en/whatsnew/elections&#34;&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; show that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &amp;ldquo;landslide&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved.  We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we&amp;rsquo;re the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can argue Java is dying, but the community is not.  And I think we&amp;rsquo;re exactly the people to guide its future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: x-small;&#34;&gt;PS (Warning: gratuitous plug incoming) If you&amp;rsquo;re at all Java-curious and you like drinking and attempting to be social, join us this Tuesday for our monthly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/events/16360581/&#34;&gt;Developer Sessions&lt;/a&gt; at the Porterhouse in Covent Garden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cyclist tribes</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/cyclist_tribes/</link>
            <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/cyclist_tribes/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Living and working in central London, you quickly learn that the fastest way around town is to cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My extensive research into this activity has shown there are a number of different cycling tribes. Of course, I have split them into the two groups that are most appropriate to me: 1) slower than me and 2) faster than me. You can probably tell what sort of a cyclist I am by my attitude to the two groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slower than me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wicker shopping basket. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what the rest of the bike looks like, or the biker, I will always try to get ahead of these.  The extra scary ones are the women in flowing dresses who might be university professors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Cycle_Hire&#34;&gt;Boris Bikes&lt;/a&gt;.  When there&amp;rsquo;s a tube strike, Avoid At All Costs.  These people probably haven&amp;rsquo;t been on a bike since they were in school, and it shows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hoody (always a male) on a BMX-style bike with the seat far too low, riding in too low a gear, with baggy jeans that show their&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; everything. Never have lights on their bikes.  Always has a satchel / record bag for maximum inappropriately-dressed-for-cycling points. These buggers are a pain because they never obey traffic lights and will join the road from the pavement on either side, cutting you up in the process. Getting past them is easy, keeping them behind you is much harder. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not wearing a helmet. Probably not a serious cyclist, so probably easy to overtake. A similar category to the hoody, doesn&amp;rsquo;t obey traffic laws and enormously unpredictable. Otherwise known as an organ donor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing a skirt. Of course, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to me. In the same category: jeans, sandals, high-heeled shoes (not all at once). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;2. Faster than me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleats. If you have cleats on the bike I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you go first from the lights. You&amp;rsquo;ll be fast and possibly suicidal when weaving through traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lycra, especially on a guy. Even if they&amp;rsquo;re not faster than me, they will always overtake, and always pull in front of me at lights. It&amp;rsquo;s an ego thing.  Something about those tight shorts possibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Panniers. Generally, but not always, a “proper” cyclist, even if they&amp;rsquo;re on a rubbish bike. These guys have experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;One to watch: businessman in a suit on a Brompton. You can&amp;rsquo;t trust these guys, they can be deceptively fast. It&amp;rsquo;s always embarrassing to be overtaken by them. How do they not sweat into their Armani?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who does that leave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my lot: helmet, high vis jacket, shorts (knee-length with pockets). Usually obeys the lights, quick enough, some unpredictability when over-/under-taking. Most of these guys will weave to some extent, but not suicidally.  My tribe is probably one of the biggest, and it leads to lots of subtle negotiation at traffic lights - sizing each other up - checking the bike, the kit, the shoes - to decide whether or not to pull ahead or drop back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I mess with people&amp;rsquo;s heads in summer by occasionally wearing a short skirt (with shorts underneath, I&amp;rsquo;m not out to cause accidents) and wedge sandals, and cycling at 20mph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to conform to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>TradeTech 2011 - Not like a developer conference</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/tradetech_2011__not_like_a_developer_conference/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/tradetech_2011__not_like_a_developer_conference/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading.  I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bWCpxKcxqUo/TahF0DBHxII/AAAAAAAAIAc/XXZzeNj_4K0/s1600/DSC_0009.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bWCpxKcxqUo/TahF0DBHxII/AAAAAAAAIAc/XXZzeNj_4K0/s320/DSC_0009.jpg&#34; style=&#34;cursor: move;&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve been to.  For example, I popped into &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX&lt;/a&gt; this week (albeit in the evening for drinks).  At technology conferences (&amp;lt;gross-generalisation&amp;gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.  Suits would be unusual (&amp;lt;/gross-generalisation&amp;gt;).  At this place, people were scarily conformist.  A few years back, the suits at least would be different colours – navy, greys and black – and may or may not include pin stripes.  On Thuresday, almost everyone was wearing a particular shade of tasteful dark grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also pretty shocked at the time people snuck off to go to the pub.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m all in favour of imbibing alcoholic beverages as frequently as possible.  And I prefer networking in the pub to poncing around in some conference centre.  But I feel it&amp;rsquo;s Bad Form, and I was surprised (and a little bit jealous) that it seemed to be the norm.  I felt for all of the later presenters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YInq4o3Vu8c/TahGzuaMylI/AAAAAAAAIAk/vCmhBplBl3g/s1600/DSC_0001.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YInq4o3Vu8c/TahGzuaMylI/AAAAAAAAIAk/vCmhBplBl3g/s320/DSC_0001.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Still, I showed my support for them and I turned up to some actual presentations.  The most interesting ones to me were Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller talking about her time as head of MI5, and Richard Peterson going Inside the Trader&amp;rsquo;s Brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Baroness was talking about leadership during times of crisis – she was in charge shortly after 9/11.  What I found interesting, and resonated with me, was her focus on her people.  An intelligence organisation is all about the people who work for it.  She stressed that it was important to bring fun into the work place, especially because it was a particularly traumatic period to be working.  She instigated family days and helped the employees show their families what it was they did.  I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure how much they could show, given the nature of that industry.  But I liked that she understood the people were more than just minions, workers in a hive, that they had families and that they wanted to be proud of their work and share it with the significant people in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She also refused to take credit for anything for herself, but talked about her team, about the people around her and in the organisation. I like leaders who recognise that it&amp;rsquo;s not all about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that stuck with me the most is she said that leaders who take themselves too seriously are not taken seriously by their underlings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3a8b0gyz_wM/TahHg3a-m-I/AAAAAAAAIAo/izyXXXYoXbI/s1600/DSC_0005.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;214&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3a8b0gyz_wM/TahHg3a-m-I/AAAAAAAAIAo/izyXXXYoXbI/s320/DSC_0005.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Richard Peterson&amp;rsquo;s presentation was about the risk-taking and risk-avoidance areas of the brain.  He showed how your risk-taking behaviour is influenced by bias, and how subtle it is.  There was a lot of interesting stuff in this, which scratches my random-interest-in-psychology itch, and confirms what I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading/hearing about how behaviour can be triggered and changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately he gave some advice for how to reduce the impact the rest of the world might have on your trading strategy, which is applicable to all of us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain healthy routines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take time to reflect daily&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Letting go&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The ulterior motive for me to be at TradeTech was to watch my boss&amp;rsquo;s “How To Do 100,000 Transactions Per Second At Less Than 1 Millisecond Latency?” presentation.  This was a cut-down and updated version of the one he and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;at QCon&lt;/a&gt; last year.  If you are at all interested in concurrency, high performance, or programming generally, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth the hour to watch it.  It outlines the architecture we use at &lt;a href=&#34;http://community.lmaxtrader.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; to get very high performance from our exchange without using anything particularly special in terms of hardware.  All it takes is good design and something Martin calls mechanical sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway enough corporate plugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I came back from TradeTech with lots of ideas of things I wanted to do at work and ways to help us market the platform in future.  I also came back with a certain cynicism for these types of very vendor-heavy events.  However, I did meet some interesting people, and it was a different crowd to my usual technical comfort zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And it did get me thinking, which is really all these things should do.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CSS for Developers: Horizontal and Vertical Centring</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;First, an apology.  I will be using the British spelling for &amp;ldquo;centre&amp;rdquo;, because, well, I&amp;rsquo;m British.  But it gets really confusing because you have to use the American spelling in the code.  And doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;Centring&amp;rdquo; just look wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 20px;&#34;&gt;Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical Centring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;One of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it.  In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.1 Horizontal Centring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centring a paragraph of text is clearly easy - all you need is &lt;code&gt;text-align: center&lt;/code&gt;.  However, sometimes you want to centre a block, something like a div, without having all the text centred as well.  This is slightly trickier than you might expect, because the only CSS attributes you have are for centring text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-s_aPLxH1lO0/TZ85v7cEiDI/AAAAAAAAH-s/f6Glb4ynFq8/s1600/Horizontal+Centering.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

   &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #div1, #div13 {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: #DDDDDD;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #div2, #div14 {&lt;br /&gt;

       }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #to-center {&lt;br /&gt;            margin-left: auto;&lt;br /&gt;            margin-right: auto;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 200px;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 5px solid red;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #to-center2 {&lt;br /&gt;            margin-left: auto;&lt;br /&gt;            margin-right: auto;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 200px;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 5px solid red;&lt;br /&gt;            display: block;&lt;br /&gt;            position: relative;&lt;br /&gt;            text-align: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;to-center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div1&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Two&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div3&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Three&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container5&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;to-center2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div13&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div14&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Two&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div15&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Three&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;margin-left: auto&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;margin-right: auto&lt;/code&gt; on the block you want to centre is a neat trick for doing this.  And it works fine in Chrome and Firefox.  However, it&amp;rsquo;s not so great in IE 7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7CjwdD0e5Zs/TaQMBDIixyI/AAAAAAAAH-0/pr1B7IG1ZTw/s1600/centering-in-ie.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;173&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7CjwdD0e5Zs/TaQMBDIixyI/AAAAAAAAH-0/pr1B7IG1ZTw/s400/centering-in-ie.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick for getting it centred here (the second block) is to set &lt;code&gt;text-align: centre&lt;/code&gt; on the div containing the block to centre (&lt;code&gt;container5&lt;/code&gt;), then reset the &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; on the centred block (&lt;code&gt;to-center2&lt;/code&gt;) so the text isn&amp;rsquo;t centred.  Yes, a total faff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is some good news.  You can get IE to behave the same way as the more sane browsers by setting it into Strict Mode:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-leiXBjTwj-Q/TaQN9OV5ToI/AAAAAAAAH-4/qKj3Kr8nOxc/s1600/strict-mode-ie.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;173&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-leiXBjTwj-Q/TaQN9OV5ToI/AAAAAAAAH-4/qKj3Kr8nOxc/s400/strict-mode-ie.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember kids: Strict Mode Is Your Friend.  And all you need to do is add the following to the top of your HTML file:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &amp;ldquo;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&amp;rdquo;

   &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div1&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Two&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div3&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Three&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container3&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div7&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;One&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div8&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Massive line of text that needs to wrap to show the centering totally doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when you have more than one line of text.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;div9&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Three&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Given some of the problems with horizontal alignment, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise to find vertical alignment is not simple at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Us straightforward developer types would expect to be able to put &lt;code&gt;vertical-align: middle&lt;/code&gt; on a div and expect all content inside that div to be, well, vertically aligned in the middle.  However this is not the case - see the orange block above.  A quick Google will tell you why this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, and I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to duplicate the explanation here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a nice hack which works for single lines of text though: if you set the &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of the container and the &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt; to the same value, the text will be vertically centred within that container (see the yellow panel, &lt;code&gt;div5&lt;/code&gt;, above). This works really well for things like buttons or icons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work so well for paragraphs of text or sentences that might wrap, &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt; is for a single line of text only.  See the cyan panel above for what happens if your text wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d love to give you an answer on how to get this to work for text that wraps, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a satisfactory solution yet.  What I usually do is set a fixed height on the container and then set the margin on the text so that it sits in a way that looks vaguely centred.  Not a solution I&amp;rsquo;m happy with, because a) it can sometimes render slightly differently on different browsers b) it&amp;rsquo;s a very fragile solution if you&amp;rsquo;re going to internationalise your page as some languages will have longer or shorter paragraphs and c) it feels like a massive hack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a nice solution for vertically centring paragraphs of text I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to show your employees how much you hate them</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_to_show_your_employees_how_much_you_hate_them/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/how_to_show_your_employees_how_much_you_hate_them/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Kitchen Is Not For Eating In&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since eating and drinking is unfortunately a fundamental part of being human and staying alive, you will need to provide your staff with a space that pretends to address these needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best example I have seen so far has been a &amp;ldquo;kitchen&amp;rdquo; with: no sink; no kettle; no microwave; a tiny under-counter fridge for employee food (for approx 50 employees); nowhere to sit and a maximum capacity of 3 people standing. You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering how I knew it was a kitchen.  Well, it had a counter top. And a coffee machine which also dispensed slightly warmed water.  And The Largest Drinking Water Dispenser In The World&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;The most important thing to remember here is that This Is Not A Communal Space.  Heaven forbid that your minions actually &lt;i&gt;talk &lt;/i&gt;to each other.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For bonus points: if you really want to show your code monkeys how much you despise them, you can dispense with the coffee machine entirely and supply only Nescafe Gold Blend instant coffee.  Honestly, developers don&amp;rsquo;t care what form their caffeine comes in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Importance Of The Loo/Bathroom/Restroom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note for our North American brethren - there&amp;rsquo;s no bath in there and I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t go there to rest.  Can we call them toilets and be done with it?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the cubicle door looks like it&amp;rsquo;s already come off the hinges a couple of times and been sellotaped back on, if the cubicles are made of plywood, if there&amp;rsquo;s a genuine chance that someone could get trapped in there by the dodgy door lock, if the loo paper is that tracing paper you used to get in school, perfect. You&amp;rsquo;ve managed to convey to your staff just how little they mean to you.  If you have been successful in this, your employees will show you exactly how they feel about you by the state they leave the bathrooms in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bonus points: don&amp;rsquo;t pay the cleaning staff enough so the paper and towels aren&amp;rsquo;t replaced frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Office Canteen Is Also Not For Eating In&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve done your job correctly with the kitchen and the toilets, your employees are probably desperate for somewhere they can congregate.  You must not allow this - if they get together, they could have Dangerous Conversations, where they Share Ideas and Collaborate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;A rookie mistake would be to not provide a canteen at all.  Do not fall into this trap! If you don&amp;rsquo;t provide food on site, your staff will leave the building, and who knows where they&amp;rsquo;re going to go, what they&amp;rsquo;ll get up to, who they might meet?  No, you want to provide them with facilities you control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;However, you want them to go to their miserable little cubicles to eat, so make sure there isn&amp;rsquo;t enough space for them to sit in the canteen.  For best results, provide a couple of tables and chairs but ensure they&amp;rsquo;re always filled.  That gives them elusive hope that maybe, some day, they will be the ones on that table.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;For bonus points: have a separate management restaurant.  This should be visible enough that your employees are aware it exists and that it&amp;rsquo;s better (table service, for example), but private enough that it becomes a mythical place. Then you must make sure they know, every day, that they are not allowed to use it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go For Tones Of Grey And Brown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing says &amp;ldquo;your life is worthless&amp;rdquo; like a 1970s-council-style-office.  If it&amp;rsquo;s made of concrete and has laminated mirrored windows, so much the better.  To go the extra mile, put up 10 foot high &amp;ldquo;inspirational&amp;rdquo; photos of people playing on beaches, in black and white.  That way your employees will remember that there is an exciting world out there, but they can&amp;rsquo;t get to it, and they can&amp;rsquo;t even enjoy it by proxy in this miserable, monochromatic office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bonus points: your cupboards should all be laminated Formica, in murky brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce Natural Light Sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think that working in a basement was the worst fate that could befall me. After I did it twice, I swore to never again work in an office with no natural light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is an even more devious way to make your staff miserable. Ensure there are windows in the office, nice big ones.  Then build cubicles throughout the floor, so that your employees can see there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a window, but they cannot see out of it, or receive any actual light from it.  Watch them pine and fade away, or fight over the desks close to the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bonus points: make sure the people closest to the windows have their monitors angled for maximum screen glare.  Then these unfortunates will close the office blinds voluntarily, and really minimise vitamin D production in your minions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide Beds/Bedrooms In The Office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you might be thinking that this is a little cushy for your minions.  I can assure you, the drain on morale is worth it.  By providing beds, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to shell out for expensive hotels for visiting employees, or for taxis for those who have to work late.  It gives your staff the message that they belong to you, you even own their sleeping hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For bonus points: put the bedrooms on the Management Floor (you know, that special floor for those who have Made It), so that your lowest-level employees have to walk through this opulent splendour in order to grab a couple of hours of poor quality sleep, before being herded back into their cubicles to put in another 20 hour day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what size company you are, by following some or all of these rules you can successfully communicate to your Peons just how meaningless their little lives are to you.  Large companies seem to be particularly good at this, but a determined start-up can also alienate all three of its employees if it tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By showing your staff how much you hate them, you are sure to attract and retain the best quality people, and motivate them to work hard and efficiently to realise business value for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: xx-small;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It was the size of a wardrobe.  All it did was filter and UV &amp;ldquo;purify&amp;rdquo; tap water.  It  also claimed to be smart, it would dispense a cup if you needed one and detect if you didn&amp;rsquo;t.  It attempted to determine the size of the container you placed in it and fill it appropriately (and failed every time).  It would tell you how many seconds were left until it had finished filling your vessel, but not give you the option to stop it, or to continue for longer.  Seriously.  A tap would have been fine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: xx-small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: xx-small;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know - they really DO care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks, actual work has conspired to keep me away from the blog. How rude. I miss &amp;ldquo;the beach&amp;rdquo; already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems only fair to summarise the lessons I have learnt whilst masquerading as an architect on a short consulting stint with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dancingmango.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Marc McNeill&lt;/a&gt;.  Simon Brown at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codingthearchitecture.com/&#34;&gt;Coding the Architecture&lt;/a&gt; is much better at talking about this stuff than I am, but I need to update the blog with something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Ask dumb questions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone&amp;rsquo;s called you in because they want your help, and presumably if their problem was simple they would have fixed it already.  You&amp;rsquo;re not there to know everything out of the box, you&amp;rsquo;re there to find out what&amp;rsquo;s going on and summarise it. That means asking questions, even the dumb ones.  That&amp;rsquo;s something I learnt off &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davefarley.net/&#34;&gt;my previous boss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Draw lots of pretty pictures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a developer, I like to think in code, I like to poke around it to find out what&amp;rsquo;s going on.  But if you want to get a feel for the bigger picture, not having access to the code, or even the documentation, could be better.  It forces you to look beyond the detail.  Sketch things out on the whiteboard to help get the picture of the domain and the systems in your head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there&amp;rsquo;s always the worry that your pictures aren&amp;rsquo;t the reality.  That&amp;rsquo;s why you need to&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Check your theories/pictures/numbers with everyone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first week of the engagement I made some assumptions based on the information I had gathered so far.  Once I&amp;rsquo;d run those past the architects and developers really working on the code, I found they were only half the story.  The feedback from those guys helped evolve the picture of the current state of play, and shaped the future direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Take notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially of acronyms used and people&amp;rsquo;s names and roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably more a &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; thing.  My memory works as an index, so I need the detail somewhere - I can remember I wrote something about something, and where I wrote it, but I won&amp;rsquo;t remember the details.  I also find that simply writing things down helps to get it straight in my head.  I probably didn&amp;rsquo;t use 50% of my notes, but all that information was in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Buy your own whiteboard pens!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a lot of places, as a consultant and a permanent employee.  And one thing you can almost guarantee is that the pens in your meeting room will not work.  Or they&amp;rsquo;ll be permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a board rubber and spray cleaner, but that&amp;rsquo;s probably my OCD&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of an intense two weeks we had delivered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A picture of the existing architecture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pictures of three phases of future architecture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An approximate roadmap for delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guide estimates for the stories discovered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;and pages and pages of supporting diagrams and information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air in Les Alpes must&amp;rsquo;ve helped get the brain moving!  Of course, I took my camera on my little jaunt to France.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K4qsRxew0X4/TVma3mkCSmI/AAAAAAAAH-Q/IFeWDHl1W4U/s1600/DSC_0128.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-K4qsRxew0X4/TVma3mkCSmI/AAAAAAAAH-Q/IFeWDHl1W4U/s400/DSC_0128.JPG&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great first role for me at ThoughtWorks.  I worked my socks off and thoroughly enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CSS for Developers: Cross Browser Table Border Behaviour</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/css_for_developers_cross_browser_table_border_behaviour/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the aims of this series is to highlight some stupid gotchas in support for CSS in the different browsers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s gotcha is table borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, yes, I said don&amp;rsquo;t use tables.  What I means is, don&amp;rsquo;t use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data.  Like, for examples, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&amp;hellip; eccentric&amp;hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.  Actually to be specific, it&amp;rsquo;s IE7 only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TUKbXmpH7EI/AAAAAAAAH8U/r5TfaQlzi9E/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-28+at+10.28.51.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TUKbXmpH7EI/AAAAAAAAH8U/r5TfaQlzi9E/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-28+at+10.28.51.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Table Borders&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        table, td {&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid black;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        td {&lt;br /&gt;            height: 20px;&lt;br /&gt;            min-width: 5px;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;table cellpadding=&amp;quot;0&amp;rdquo; cellspacing=&amp;quot;0&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;first cell&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;second&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HTML here is a simple table with a border round all the cells (using CSS &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;, not the deprecated border attribute on the table) - a fairly common situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how it renders in IE7:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TUKh2Lb-S0I/AAAAAAAAH8c/9BQkjC_UaFg/s1600/table-borders-in-ie.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;466&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TUKh2Lb-S0I/AAAAAAAAH8c/9BQkjC_UaFg/s640/table-borders-in-ie.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the distinct lack of a border around the lower two cells.  If a table cell is empty, or contains a div which is empty, IE doesn&amp;rsquo;t render the cell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheat to get around this is to add &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;/code&gt; into every empty cell - either inside the div, if there&amp;rsquo;s a div in there, or inside the td if there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else in there.  Then IE wakes up and remembers to render the borders.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>My Experiences with Android Development</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_experiences_with_android_development/</link>
            <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_experiences_with_android_development/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I was missing coding, and because my friend and I had an awesome phone app idea at the weekend, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try my hand at developing an Android application this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to give a quick overview of my preliminary thoughts on getting started on this endeavour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&amp;rsquo;ve got more than 10 years Java experience, but any UI for the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on was always a web UI.  I am &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; new to mobile app development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Started&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent maybe a day and a half reading the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html&#34;&gt;Android developer documentation&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to hack out a quick &amp;lsquo;droid app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals.html&#34;&gt;Application Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; section actually made sense to me.  There appears to be a clear architecture with design guidelines laid out for developers to follow.  This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be a surprise I suppose, but years of hacking around with web UIs with poorly implemented MVC architectures must have left me thinking that all frameworks are less &amp;ldquo;frame&amp;rdquo; and more &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the disaster of trying to get my first JDK working on my 486 - what a nightmare!  And getting Tomcat 3 installed and running?  Forget it.  I also remember the last time I made a serious stab at a learning a new technology.  I tried develop a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.grails.org/&#34;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt;/Groovy application in Eclipse.  The IS guys had to rescue my laptop from me during that enterprise before I could do it any serious damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installing the SDK on my mac was surprisingly simple, especially bearing in mind I&amp;rsquo;m new both to OSX and to mobile development.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s because Android development has been well thought out and well supported, or if it&amp;rsquo;s a function of both the industry&amp;rsquo;s maturity and my own experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The integration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&#34;&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/a&gt; was much slicker than I expected, especially since I&amp;rsquo;m using the freebie Community edition.  I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact steps to tell it I wanted to create an Android project, but it must have been ridiculously easy otherwise I would remember the trauma.  I do remember a little confusion around installing the Android platform - I hadn&amp;rsquo;t understood the difference between installing the SDK and then installing a specific API for it.  But the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/othertools.html#android&#34;&gt;android&lt;/a&gt; application got me on the right track in the end.  And then when I clicked the &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; button in IntelliJ, hey presto!  The emulator appeared and there was my app!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;I loved the emulator.  I had some confused idea that I would have to plug my own phone into the laptop to see my application.  Instead, the emulator looks enough like my actual phone to give me decent feedback on how the app is going to behave.  The downside is I was trying to play with the camera, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see how that would really work in the emulator, but I got a fair idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did it work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;I managed to get a rudimentary application running, with a button and some descriptive text (it&amp;rsquo;s not about to win any awards).  The button was supposed to launch the camera viewer, but my first few attempts just resulted in the crash notification.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long to figure out how to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/debug-tasks.html&#34;&gt;logcat&lt;/a&gt; to see the stack trace and see I hadn&amp;rsquo;t set the permissions correctly to use the camera, so I rooted through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/graphics/CameraPreview.html&#34;&gt;CameraPreview&lt;/a&gt; example in &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/index.html&#34;&gt;APIDemos &lt;/a&gt;to figure out how to set up the AndroidManifest.xml correctly, and rather amazingly it all worked!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any downsides?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;I was surprised (and slightly disappointed) at the amount of XML configuration.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of evil Spring and Ant XML in the enterprise and I thought frameworks were moving away from that.  The manifest I can understand I suppose, but it felt a bit weird to be defining the UI in XML.  It seemed like a bit of an afterthought tagged on after all the well-defined architecture behind the scenes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;But maybe this will make more sense to me as I develop my application further.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to be able to get an Android application (albeit a very basic one) working in only a few hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development in IntelliJ was &lt;i&gt;much &lt;/i&gt;easier than I expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The documentation is actually very good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll see how I feel about it when I start trying to do more than a very simple example application.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CSS for Developers: Column Layout Using CSS</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/search/label/css&#34;&gt;series of CSS&lt;/a&gt; hints / tips / cheats for developers (and other technical-but-not-UI people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac.  The originals were on Firefox on Ubuntu so I can tell you the behaviour is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Part Three: Column Layout Using CSS (or: still no excuse to use tables)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s example is a simple one, but worth knowing all the same.  The aim is, once again, not to use HTML tables to provide any sort of layout.  In most cases not only does using a div reduce the size of your DOM (and potentially help &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/gwt-why-verticalpanel-is-evil.html&#34;&gt;improve the performance of your page&lt;/a&gt;), it&amp;rsquo;s actually a lot less complicated to organise your layout this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.1 Display Elements or Text in Columns&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TT1v4bAebwI/AAAAAAAAH8Q/oM4PAaNx3dI/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-24+at+12.21.02.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TT1v4bAebwI/AAAAAAAAH8Q/oM4PAaNx3dI/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-24+at+12.21.02.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Column layout&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #col1 {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: yellow;&lt;br /&gt;            /**have to know the width **/&lt;br /&gt;            width: 30%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #col2 {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: lightBlue;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 30%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;col1&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;col2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again you can see we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/css-for-developers-joy-of-floats.html&#34;&gt;using &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; on the divs&lt;/a&gt; to get them to appear side-by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code is much more intuitive organised this way - everything from a single column is grouped together in a single div.  If this was done using tables, you&amp;rsquo;d have the content for a single column scattered in different cells on different rows of the table.  Re-arranging the order of the columns in the case of tables is much more of a pain in the neck.  With a div, it&amp;rsquo;s a simple move.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Gah!!  &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/20/manfest-destiny-2/&#34;&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  what I was &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/on-how-not-to-target-girl-geeks.html&#34;&gt;talking about&lt;/a&gt; - it&amp;rsquo;s pink, it mentions shoes, and it&amp;rsquo;s about as patronising as you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/&#34;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html&#34;&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/markzuckerberg&#34;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linux.org/info/linus.html&#34;&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt;?  I bet for a start it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags.  And it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in baby blue either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Which leads me nicely onto the next subject I have strong opinions on: Role models.  Why do we need them? &lt;i&gt;Do &lt;/i&gt;we need them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If there is &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; good to be salvaged from that horrific infographic, it&amp;rsquo;s that it gave me what I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to research - some female role models in technology. Unfortunately it hit the other button I was ranting about earlier - they&amp;rsquo;re all very presentable and polished.  I don&amp;rsquo;t doubt their value as role models, it&amp;rsquo;s great to have people like that to try and emulate.  But surely there must be IT women out there who look like real people?  And how many of them started as programmers?  I know there&amp;rsquo;s a wider issue around women in technical professions, and women at the top of organisations in any business domain, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep focused on the issues faced by girl programmers specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do we need role models?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel almost a responsibility to be a role model.  I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; because I felt it would give me a better platform for greater visibility, so I could show that girls could do this job.  I feel passionately that the industry desperately needs excellent role models to overcome the stereotypes kids are absorbing (in our western society) about what it means to be a programmer(/developer/techy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/mnowster&#34;&gt;Mazz&lt;/a&gt; feels quite differently.  She doesn&amp;rsquo;t see why she should have a greater responsibility to be a role model simply because of her gender.  It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be expected of her co-workers.  She suggests that by making a career in programming an option for all, or worse, by targeting specific groups (e.g. women) we&amp;rsquo;re devaluing the industry.  Surely we&amp;rsquo;re stronger if we only attract people who are interested in the first place? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a week long trip to Vegas (it&amp;rsquo;s a hard life), Mazz and I realised we actually agreed on fundamentals:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mazz doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe we need female role models to tempt women into programming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I believe we need more diverse role models than we currently have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Mazz doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a role model because she&amp;rsquo;s perfectly happy getting on with doing her job bloody brilliantly, then that&amp;rsquo;s totally cool - after all, if minorities are expected to do stuff which distracts them from their day job, it&amp;rsquo;s going to make them less appealing to employers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My aim in being a role model was not specifically to get more girls into programming, but to show to the world that we&amp;rsquo;re not all speccy asexual white boys.  Some of us are speccy white girls.  And this shows the ridiculousness of trying to encourage girls to be role models - you&amp;rsquo;ve only changed one dimension. And having a token bisexual black disabled older lady is only going to narrow the field you&amp;rsquo;re appealing to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;So what do we need to change?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Back to the question that started this off - &amp;ldquo;what do we need to do to encourage the girls?&amp;rdquo;.  The answer, it would seem, is not to roll out the girls, dress them up and parade them around.  After all, we got here with no female role models.  And we may very well have been put off by role models like us - a teenage Mazz and a teenage Trish would probably not identify with the heel-wearing blonde I&amp;rsquo;ve become, despite my all-round awesomeness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I worked at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ford.co.uk/AboutFord/CompanyInformation/FordinBritain&#34;&gt;Ford &lt;/a&gt;they used to tell us a story about marketing.  They told us that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harley-davidson.com/&#34;&gt;Harley Davidson&lt;/a&gt; understood that to market something, you had to market it at the person your customers &lt;i&gt;wanted&lt;/i&gt; to be.  A Harley is a statement, a lifestyle choice.  They focused on promoting that lifestyle, promoting the image of the Harley biker, all leather and macho attitude.  They knew that the majority of their customers were CEOs, lawyers, doctors.  Guys who&amp;rsquo;d made it in life and had the cash to spend. But if they&amp;rsquo;d marketed Harley Davidson directly to the stereotypes of these guys they would have lost their market.  These men did not buy a Harley as part of their CEO persona.  They bought them because they aspired to be the leather-wearing macho guy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how true that story is, but I do know Harley Davidson revitalised their failing business by focusing on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/07/28/case-study-harley-davidson&#34;&gt;creating a community around their brand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So back to the question: How do we get more girls into programming?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the answer is: We&amp;rsquo;re asking the wrong question. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real question is: How do we attract more than just the &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; geeks into programming?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And when you ask that question, you realise it&amp;rsquo;s absurd to assume that attractive female role models and women-centered events are going to fix the problem, or even make any significant headway on it.  You&amp;rsquo;re narrowing your field of appeal instead of broadening it.  You&amp;rsquo;re being exclusive instead of inclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can we find appropriate role models to represent us?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;We have diversity amongst geeks.  We&amp;rsquo;ve got diversity along the typical dimensions (age/race/sexuality/gender etc etc).  But in addition we&amp;rsquo;re all individuals and we&amp;rsquo;re going to appeal to other individuals.  I might appeal to someone who likes shoes.  I might appeal to someone who likes photography.  I might appeal to someone who thinks Java developers should give a toss about the user experience.  I might appeal to someone who is massively OCD about the names of their variables.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t care what little boxes those people tick on the dimensions that make absolutely no difference to their ability to program.  In fact, if we focus less on this and more on our general awesomeness as geeks, we might find so-called minorities are happier to represent us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;Even with diverse role models we might have trouble getting the media to let go of their stereotype of the geek programming in their bedroom.  But we might not - I did a search for &amp;ldquo;geek&amp;rdquo; on The Sun&amp;rsquo;s website, and I found a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; more references to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Geek-Chic-Style-(for-Girls)&#34;&gt;geek chic&lt;/a&gt;, and celebrities claiming to be geeks, than to stories of the lonely computer programmer who went crazy and killed everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the time of the geek.  Let&amp;rsquo;s ride the wave and bring other people to the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So who should our role models be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/about-lmax&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; we adopted &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/gettingstarted.html&#34;&gt;Google Web Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; pretty early on.  One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI.  Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The problem is that GWT does a very nice job of pretending to be Java whilst actually compiling down to HTML and JavaScript.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t have some understanding of the end result (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3.org/DOM/&#34;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt; the browser is going to be rendering) it&amp;rsquo;s going to be hard to get the performance you need from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/trading-platforms/web-platform&#34;&gt;low-latency trading application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My number one bug-bear with GWT is &lt;a href=&#34;http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/VerticalPanel.html&#34;&gt;VerticalPanel&lt;/a&gt;.  To the uninitiated developer, this seems like the sort of thing that will be useful everywhere.  You often want stuff stacked on top of each other - think menus, lists, the layout of a dialog.  What is not obvious is that it uses tables for layout under the covers, and I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in the past that &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/css-for-developers-horizontal-layout.html&#34;&gt;Tables Should Not Be Used For Layout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A much less obvious way of getting the same result with (usually) no extra effort is to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/FlowPanel.html&#34;&gt;FlowPanel&lt;/a&gt;.  This is rendered as a div, and most of the time the elements that get inserted into it will render in a vertical stack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;VerticalPanel Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;VerticalPanel panel = new VerticalPanel();&lt;br /&gt;panel.add(/* your widget */);&lt;br /&gt;panel.add(/* your second widget */);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;VerticalPanel Rendered As HTML&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; your widget here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; your second widget here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;/tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlowPanel Code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;code&gt;FlowPanel panel = new FlowPanel();&lt;br /&gt;panel.add(/* your widget */);&lt;br /&gt;panel.add(/* your second widget */);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlowPanel Rendered As HTML&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; your widget here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; your second widget here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can see that the DOM generated for a very similar-looking 3 lines of code is much much smaller for &lt;code&gt;FlowPanel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Who Cares?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right, but we&amp;rsquo;re only talking about a few more elements, and browsers are pretty smart about optimising these things.  Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.  But if you use &lt;code&gt;VerticalPanel&lt;/code&gt; for all your containers, for every box which needs to be a slightly different colour, for every place you want to change the alignment slightly, things get very big very fast.  This is an example of real code from an early prototype, where we had several nested panels (not unheard of if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a complex dialog box with lots of elements in it.  Like, say, a deal ticket).  And I&amp;rsquo;ve stripped out a lot of the table attributes that made this even more heinous:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;table id=&amp;quot;panel1&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;          &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;              &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo; style=&amp;quot;vertical-align: top;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                &amp;lt;table class=&amp;quot;orders-input&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                      &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                        &amp;lt;table class=&amp;quot;row&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                          &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                            &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                              &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                &amp;lt;table id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                  &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                      &amp;lt;table id=&amp;quot;panel2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                        &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                          &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                            &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                              &amp;lt;table class=&amp;quot;controls&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                                &amp;lt;tbody&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                                  &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                                    &amp;lt;td align=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;                                                      &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; widget &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every &lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt; element and associated elements (&lt;code&gt;tbody&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;), you would get a single div element instead if you simply replace every instance of &lt;code&gt;VerticalPanel&lt;/code&gt; in this stack with a &lt;code&gt;FlowPanel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;panel1&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;orders-input&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;      &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;row&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;          &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;panel2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;            &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;controls&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;              &amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; widget &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See?  Much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is exactly what we did do, and we saw a noticeable speed improvement across all browsers - noticeable to a real user, not just some millisecond improvement on a performance test.  Mind you, users&amp;rsquo; brains are amazing things and your system has to react in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html&#34;&gt;less than 0.1 seconds for a user to perceive it as instantaneous&lt;/a&gt;.  So even in a browser, every millisecond counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to improved performance, you get a nice bonus: now the layout is no longer controlled by tables, you can really easily shove stuff around and make things look pretty with the clever use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/search/label/css&#34;&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re really lucky, you can chuck that stuff over to your designers and not have to do another GWT compile when someone wants to move things 3 pixels to the left.  Which they will.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;(First, let me say this post contains opinion, stereotyping and sweeping generalisations.  But that&amp;rsquo;s sort of the point.  Also I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend for one moment to speak for all girl programmers, I can only speak for myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started this blog, I wanted to just post &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; technical information.  I wanted to prove that there are girls out there doing &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically didn&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about my gender.  I wanted to prove by silence that gender is incidental to what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really work that way, does it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly because one of the first things I get asked by guys when I meet them in this industry is &amp;ldquo;why aren&amp;rsquo;t there more girl programmers?&amp;rdquo; (that&amp;rsquo;s after they ask &amp;ldquo;do you work in HR?&amp;rdquo; followed by &amp;ldquo;are you a real programmer?&amp;rdquo; - I&amp;rsquo;m not joking, this happened this week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And secondly because I&amp;rsquo;m pretty passionate about the gender issue.  To be specific: I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about &lt;i&gt;diversity&lt;/i&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m more qualified to bang on about gender rather than something like race, sexuality, age etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s started you off again this time?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking by asking &amp;ldquo;Is there anything we can do to attract more girls to the events?&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, the reason people (boys) keep asking this question is because they &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; more girls in the industry / at events.  They &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; them to feel involved and included.  I&amp;rsquo;ve said it before, but I mean it - I&amp;rsquo;ve never come across malicious sexism at work.  Yes there is subconscious sexism.  But the boys want the girls to come and play.  Why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t they?  How many boys really want to work in a team which has 12 developers and only one is a girl? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But think about it: who is the worst person to ask why girls don&amp;rsquo;t like being developers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep.  A girl developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because we love it.  We&amp;rsquo;re here because we like programming, we like our jobs, we&amp;rsquo;re good at it.  We weren&amp;rsquo;t stopped by sexism (assumed or real), by boys clubs, by not having female role models, by&amp;hellip; well, any of the myriad of reasons posited as to why girls don&amp;rsquo;t become programmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why a girl wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a programmer.  It&amp;rsquo;s brilliant!  It&amp;rsquo;s problem-solving, logical and creative, you&amp;rsquo;re usually surrounded by intelligent people who are striving toward the same goal as you, and you get to meet a lot of boys :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, back to the question at hand: how do we appeal to girls, as a user group and ultimately as an industry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots and lots of ideas kicking around this area, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to start by ranting about the things I think we&lt;i&gt; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/i&gt; be doing.  This, of course, is totally my opinion so helpings of salt might be required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;No Pink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get so angry about this!!  As if the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/dec/12/pinkstinks-the-power-of-pink&#34;&gt;pinkification&lt;/a&gt; of our little girls wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad enough, &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; (I have no idea who) think that they can inflict this upon grown-ups too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why, WHY, would a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.womenintechnology.co.uk/&#34;&gt;website that is aimed at professional technical women&lt;/a&gt; be branded in childish hues of the hated colour?  I didn&amp;rsquo;t even click on a single link, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what service it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to provide, because I was so disgusted by the colour palate I closed the browser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In particular&lt;/i&gt;, if your target demographic is the somewhat unusual creature the girl-geek, or at least the lady technologist, what makes you think that ultra-feminine colour is going to appeal to us?  &lt;a href=&#34;http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article7011125.ece&#34;&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;The November 2009 Times/Lady Geek Female Appeal Study showed that only 9% of women want technology to be feminine, let alone pink.&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think, that your average (female) maths graduate is going to decide Computing Is For Me Because It&amp;rsquo;s Pink?  Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worry about this: are these &lt;a href=&#34;http://techettes.com/&#34;&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobiles.co.uk/pink-mobile-phones.html&#34;&gt;phones&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.luuux.com/technology/pink-psp-women&#34;&gt;consoles&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.carpages.co.uk/smart/smart-fortwo-13-12-05.asp&#34;&gt;cars&lt;/a&gt;) designed by men, and that&amp;rsquo;s what they think women like?  Or were they designed by women who really believe that&amp;rsquo;s what ALL women like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please.  Stop it.  Now.  It&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Be careful about your role models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the &lt;a href=&#34;http://fwd.five.tv/gadget-show&#34;&gt;gadget show&lt;/a&gt;, for example.  I don&amp;rsquo;t actually watch it, I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, because I really don&amp;rsquo;t need someone tempting me to spend money on things I don&amp;rsquo;t require.  But as an example of this point it&amp;rsquo;s perfect - just the picture at the top of the page says it all to me: two reasonably attractive women (I know not everyone floats your boat but they&amp;rsquo;re not ugly), token black guy and two white guys who certainly don&amp;rsquo;t float my boat.  If only one of them was gay, their diversity tick sheet would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not for one second suggesting any of these guys don&amp;rsquo;t know their stuff.  That is not the point at all.  I just wonder - if one of the women looked like someone&amp;rsquo;s mum, would they have got the job?  The subconscious message here is that yes, it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine to be a girl and a geek.  But you still have to look good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s another message there - if you&amp;rsquo;re a guy and you&amp;rsquo;re into technology, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be hot. In fact, the role models we see are definitely on the Not Hot end of the scale.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://politicolnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Bill_Gates_718639.jpg&#34;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; anyone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So girls get a double-whammy - I have to know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about and look good (whilst also trying to prove that girls who look good have brains); and there are no hot guys in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm, no thanks, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get a job in marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t assume all women are the same&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact don&amp;rsquo;t assume anything about the girls you want to attract.  Actually, assume they&amp;rsquo;re people.  Like you.  And geeks.  Like you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example.  I actually do like shoes and clothes.  But plenty of my fellow girl-geeks are about as bothered about that stuff as their male counter-parts.  So trying to appeal to girls with iPhone apps that help you pick you next pair of Jimmy Choos might not be the approach you want to take.  You&amp;rsquo;ll attract a subset of women, sure, but they might not be the ones you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if you wanted to get more guys into programming, and you decided to do it by using football as the hook.  Yes, you&amp;rsquo;d get certain guys interested. But I&amp;rsquo;ve met more guys who are utterly disinterested in football in IT than I&amp;rsquo;ve met girls who dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not all the same.  We&amp;rsquo;re interested in all sorts of different stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Be very very careful about women-only events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal feelings are that there should be no need for all-girl conferences or all-girl line-ups.  To me, it implies that girls want something different to boys, and that girls only listen to other females.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are places for these sorts of things, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re aiming it at girls who might be more uncomfortable with guys around (e.g. some sort of mentoring).  So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say flat-out they&amp;rsquo;re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just I think it&amp;rsquo;s not the right angle to attack the problem.  And you&amp;rsquo;re segregating based on one dimension only, but as I said we&amp;rsquo;re all different and we all have different problems.  The issues a non-white (am I allowed to say that?) lady might face could be different to those a middle class white girl like me has to deal with.  And do you want all-black conferences, and all-gay conferences, and so on and so forth?  Why are we special?  Why are we allowed to exclude the boys?  It&amp;rsquo;s sexist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a girl-geek, I get a bit freaked out when I&amp;rsquo;m surrounded by women, even if they&amp;rsquo;re all geeks like me.  I&amp;rsquo;m much more comfortable talking to a guy, they tend not to try to read between the lines of everything you say or wonder if you&amp;rsquo;re bitching about them behing their back &amp;lt;/gross generalisation&amp;gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diversity is about being inclusive, not exclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of the girl-geek, women-in-IT movement often appears to me as if women are &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; and need different treatment. This is not helping our cause &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. It causes resentment amongst our male peers and it puts off women who don&amp;rsquo;t define themselves by their gender - people like the girls who are already in our industry. We like technology, we love programming, and we&amp;rsquo;re good at our jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know why there aren&amp;rsquo;t more girls in programming.  And I don&amp;rsquo;t have the answers as to what will tempt them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, just for me, next time you&amp;rsquo;re creating an advert or a website or something aimed at geek-girls, can we have more hot guys please?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;As promised, the Long Awaited Follow-Up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/css-for-developers-horizontal-layout.html&#34;&gt;CSS for Developers Part One&lt;/a&gt;! Well, long-awaited if you&amp;rsquo;re as afflicted with &lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html&#34;&gt;NADD&lt;/a&gt; as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick recap - the aim of this series is to provide a quick and easy how-to around the magic that is CSS.  It&amp;rsquo;s primarily aimed at developers, although I would hope it&amp;rsquo;s comprehensible to a range of tech-savvy people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: unless otherwise stated, the screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac - given an earlier version of this guide I can tell you the behaviour is identical to Firefox on Ubuntu).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Part Two: The Joy of Floats (or: why they don&amp;rsquo;t do what you think they should)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/css-for-developers-horizontal-layout.html&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; I stated that using float is a great way to position elements contained in a div.  Well, it has its downsides too.  Quite a few actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So this post documents the ones I ran into and what we did on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/trading-platforms/web-platform&#34;&gt;LMAX Trader UI&lt;/a&gt; to get it to look the way we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disclaimer: There might be better ways to do a lot of this stuff - if you locate them via Google or work them out for yourself then well done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.1 Starting a New Line Using Floats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWDOKiuyGI/AAAAAAAAH7o/aW8vVEQPwg0/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-18+at+12.09.10.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWDOKiuyGI/AAAAAAAAH7o/aW8vVEQPwg0/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-18+at+12.09.10.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Horizontal flow&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: cyan;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #center {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: yellow;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #right {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: red;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #next-line {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: green;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 200px;&lt;br /&gt;            clear: left;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;next-line&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Next Line&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;clear: left&lt;/code&gt; will reset any left float from before the div it is applied to. This will cause the div to be shown on a new line, although it can still have a float property as well&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;clear: right&lt;/code&gt; will put the div below any divs with a right float applied &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;clear: both&lt;/code&gt; will do both. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do &lt;code&gt;clear: both&lt;/code&gt; if I need to ensure the div will be on a new line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.2 Right Aligning Floated Divs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWQ_QYj2wI/AAAAAAAAH7s/fEbaFExTDoU/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-18+at+13.07.35.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWQ_QYj2wI/AAAAAAAAH7s/fEbaFExTDoU/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-18+at+13.07.35.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Float Right&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            float: right;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #center {&lt;br /&gt;            float: right;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #right {&lt;br /&gt;            float: right;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #container {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: yellow;&lt;br /&gt;            height: 26px;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #left2 {&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #center2 {&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #right2 {&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;            border: 1px solid gray;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #container2 {&lt;br /&gt;            clear: both;&lt;br /&gt;            float: right;&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: #90ee90;&lt;br /&gt;            height: 26px;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right2&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you want to right-align a number of elements (for example, buttons at the bottom of a dialog), there are two approaches. One is to set &lt;code&gt;float: right&lt;/code&gt; on each individual item (see the yellow panel above) - you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that this means the divs are displayed in reverse order, because they&amp;rsquo;re set to float to the right of each other. A better approach is to put the divs you want right-aligned into a container div and float that to the right (see the green panel). This ensures the correct ordering of the items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.3 Floating Behaviour to be Aware Of: float left next to float right (cross browser)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

   &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: blue;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;

           width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            clear: left;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #float-left {&lt;br /&gt;            clear: left;&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: purple;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #float-right {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: cyan;&lt;br /&gt;            float: right;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;next-line&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Next Line&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;float-left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Floating Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;float-right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Floating Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Firefox and Chrome (tested under Ubuntu and OS X), if you clear the float on a single div element, that div and all the ones after it will appear underneath all the previous ones.  For example, see the &amp;ldquo;Floating left&amp;rdquo; (purple) and &amp;ldquo;Floating right&amp;rdquo; (cyan) divs above.  The two divs appear on the same line, floating side-by-side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may even be the same behaviour in IE in strict mode (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if I tested it).  But by default, Internet Explorer renders this quite differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWZ428ju9I/AAAAAAAAH70/LmBX2Gw9mAA/s1600/floating-left-and-right-in-ie.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;442&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTWZ428ju9I/AAAAAAAAH70/LmBX2Gw9mAA/s640/floating-left-and-right-in-ie.png&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Apologies for some of the inconsistency in screenshots - given my choices of operating systems, getting the cursed screenshots in IE was&amp;hellip; challenging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is that in IE the &lt;code&gt;float: right&lt;/code&gt; is quite literal - it floats to the right directly underneath the last floated element, regardless of any prior &lt;code&gt;clear&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get the same behaviour across all browsers, you need to be stricter with adding containers for different content areas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Float right next to float left - correct&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: blue;&lt;br /&gt;

div, &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;, with two children, &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;.  Both of these children are floating, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually matter that one&amp;rsquo;s left and one&amp;rsquo;s right.  What you might not be able to see clearly is that the parent, &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;, has zero height.  It&amp;rsquo;s got a black border, you should be able to see that the top and bottom of the border are actually next to each other, showing the div has no height of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the children have a height, the height shrinks to fit the content, the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get at is that if you want to place something underneath the left and right divs, you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on the browser working out where the bottom is and placing other divs underneath them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34;

I&amp;rsquo;m trying to use a combination of colours, outlines etc to make the point clear, not to make it look good)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically the floated divs are effectively absolutely positioned, and therefore take up no space on the document (more on this in a later post).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I&amp;rsquo;ve got round this in the past is to set a specific height on the parent div to force any following elements to appear underneath it.  This works, but it can be fragile.  In particular, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for wrapping text (more on this later too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Still to come:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Position and Display: relative, absolute, block, inline&amp;hellip; what does it really mean?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Centring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strict Mode Is Your Friend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Column layout using CSS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;width: 100%&amp;rdquo; might go off the edge of the page&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross-browser table border behaviour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-style: normal;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.blogspot.com/2011/01/css-for-developers-horizontal-layout.html&#34;&gt;Horizontal Layout using CSS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I was fortunate enough to get a place on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://worldtour.fogcreek.com/&#34;&gt;FogBugz and Kiln World Tour&lt;/a&gt;.  I booked it before I moved jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest I had no real interest in the software.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Joel&amp;rsquo;s books and blogs since my friend Brent bought me &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590593898&#34;&gt;Joel on Software&lt;/a&gt; and made me read it (he had the foresight to know I&amp;rsquo;d want to hang on to his copy if he&amp;rsquo;d lent it to me!).  I wanted to see the man in the flesh and hear what he had to say about his software.  Because really, do we honestly need yet another bug-tracking / project-management tool?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Who would benefit from FogBugz?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s demo was really good at demonstrating exactly how you might use the software - the processes you might follow, how to raise / update a ticket and chase it, and how you can see what&amp;rsquo;s going on with the projects tracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can actually think of a number of companies I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for, or friends have worked for, that would see an improvement in productivity from using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/&#34;&gt;FogBugz&lt;/a&gt; for bug tracking / project management.  When I worked at Touch Clarity (later swallowed by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.omniture.com/&#34;&gt;Omniture&lt;/a&gt;, which was gobbled by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/&#34;&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;) I was desperately looking for a product to help us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Record defects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture new feature requests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assign tasks to developers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimate tasks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track progress - both at a project level and for individual developers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide us with a lightweight process which was easy to follow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate reports for management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the demo I saw, FogBugz will do everything we wanted at that time.  We were using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bugzilla.org/&#34;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; back then, and badly.  I&amp;rsquo;d also investigated &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xplanner.org/&#34;&gt;XPlanner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.versionone.com/Product/Product_Planning.asp&#34;&gt;VersionOne&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of other defect/project management tools, and not really seen anything that did what I wanted (certainly that was cheap enough).  But this was back in 2004/5, we were doing a half-hearted version of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremeprogramming.org/&#34;&gt;eXtreme Programming&lt;/a&gt;, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of cash to burn.  It was hard then to find a lightweight, customisable, inexpensive tool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The things I saw in FogBugz that I thought would be useful were:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nice UI - usability of these things is so frequently under-valued.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really easy to track what&amp;rsquo;s going on with a defect, to add and edit comments etc.  I actually liked that the edit feature still tracked versions of the comments, I can see how some organisations would need that audit trail.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based scheduling - I liked the way that it uses past information to have a good guess at how accurate an estimate will be, and therefore the soonest, likely and latest times a feature might be delivered by.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visibility over an individual developer&amp;rsquo;s workload.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visibility over work at a project-level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loads of charts/reports to let you slice and dice the stuff you have in there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependency management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neat integration to source control - yes, I know you can get this for loads of management tools now, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s not useful. It seemed pretty slick here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It seemed quick.  But then it could have been a locally-running instance with about 3 defects in it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The things I thought would not be so useful in a more Agile environment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based scheduling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visibility over an individual developer&amp;rsquo;s workload.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of the ways the data can be sliced and diced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependency management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;So, you like it and you don&amp;rsquo;t like it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yeah yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone all multiple-personality again.  The stuff I liked about the product would be dead useful for the types of projects that work that way - where you assign work to individual developers who estimate the work; where developers are assigned to specific projects; where stories / features might not be broken down into small, independent tasks.  These places might be running waterfall, or some agile-ish process, or no process at all.  A tool like this will give them much better visibility over what&amp;rsquo;s going on, over which deadlines won&amp;rsquo;t be met, over who&amp;rsquo;s estimates are flaky and who&amp;rsquo;s are generally reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However even before I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt;, before I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/about-lmax&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;, I was sold on Agile as a more natural way to run development teams (this is despite having worked with Touch Clarity&amp;rsquo;s sort-of-XP and A Very Large Media Organisation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://bitsnwidgets.com/2008/04/19/DontBeASCRUMBUT.aspx&#34;&gt;ScrumBut&lt;/a&gt;).  The problems that some of the features in FogBugz tries to address are similar to the problems that Agile (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html&#34;&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scrumalliance.org/learn_about_scrum&#34;&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://availagility.co.uk/2008/10/28/kanban-flow-and-cadence/&#34;&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt; or some hybrid of these) is also supposed to address.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evidence-based scheduling: I totally agree with getting statistical about this - teams and management should have a good idea how reliable estimates are.  But one of the ways to reduce the variation is to have the estimates done by the team.  At LMAX, we would have three developers estimate every story.  With any luck at least one of those would know enough about it to provide some solid technical guidance on what was involved, but if there wasn&amp;rsquo;t someone in a group of three that had that knowledge, chances were pretty good the team generally were going to be pretty vague on it.  Granted, if you&amp;rsquo;re using FogBugz you can enter the team estimate instead of just the individual who is going to implement it and then your evidence-based scheduling will be for team-estimates instead of personal ones.  This is totally fine, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing - I just think we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use evidence-based scheduling to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; the problem that estimates are just that - an estimate, a guess.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visibility over a developer&amp;rsquo;s workload: If you&amp;rsquo;re doing pair programming (XP), if the team takes ownership of the implementation of features / stories (Scrum), there&amp;rsquo;s no need to look at how busy an individual developer is.  Yes, there are lots of organisations that do allocate work to individuals.  In many (most?) Agile-practicing teams, this will not be happening.  So really you only need visibility over a team or project level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reporting: Ah, I love reporting.  I love data, statistics, pretty charts. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m secretly a project manager.  But it&amp;rsquo;s SO easy to get hung up on the stats, on one tiny measurement, rather than the bigger picture - are we getting closer to &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; or not?  I think you should be able to get at all that data, but not get carried away micro-optimising for metrics which may be hiding bigger problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dependency management: another thing that is dead important in some types of teams or organisations.  But the last few Agile projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on have not tracked hard-link dependencies at all - each story should stand alone, should be estimated on the basis of just doing that piece of work.  Yes, this is idealistic, and even in the projects where we did not officially track dependencies, we&amp;rsquo;d have a good idea of a very general order things should be done in (or an idea of the order things could be done in to make life easier).  But these things can be fluid, if a specific feature needs to be done now, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to do every single story that might have a tiny piece of functionality this story is dependent on - just tackle this story and everything you need for it.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;All of those points could be blog posts in their own right, I know it&amp;rsquo;s taken me years to get my head around the way I personally see Agile.  But you get the idea, or maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t - that&amp;rsquo;s fine, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re in exactly the sort of place that could use FogBugz to improve your productivity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;FogBugz vs Mingle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I started at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt; last week, so I&amp;rsquo;d better mention that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks Studios&lt;/a&gt; have a competitor product, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/mingle-agile-project-management&#34;&gt;Mingle&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m reasonably well-qualified to talk about it since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it in anger for the last two years in a maturing agile environment, and I had my Mingle &lt;s&gt;indoctrination&lt;/s&gt; induction last week.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To me, the main difference is the angle the two products are taking to approach the same problem: how do you provide a tool that&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;is easy and lightweight enough to use that people (particularly developers) will keep it up to date;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tracks just the right amount of data that people have visibility over the state of development (What are we doing?  Are we going to hit our deadlines? What are our blockers?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;To me, it seems FogBugz is coming from the traditional development model - it might not be anything as formal as waterfall, but it may not be based on short iterations and assumes individuals rather than teams are assigned work.  Mingle was developed for the Agile team, e.g. collective responsibility, pair programming, short iterations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mingle is highly configurable, and while FogBugz has a number of templates and custom work flows, Mr Spolsky specifically stated at the demo that these really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used.  That they&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard to find a process that works, and we should all follow that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, Mingle embraces the differences between teams/processes and FogBugz specifically discourages it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I reckon these things are actually also the potential downfalls for both products too:  Mingle can be abused so badly that it adds no value; FogBugz could be so prescriptive it slows down productivity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s horses for courses, every tool has its advantages and disadvantages.  Or should I be pushing Mingle at this point until I pass my probation??&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Kiln, and an introduction to DVCS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good Lord, I&amp;rsquo;ve written all that stuff and that&amp;rsquo;s only from the short demo at the start of the day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fortunately I have a lot less to say about the latter part.  It was an introduction to Distributed Version Control (DVCS), and it was pitched absolutely right for someone like me.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never used a DVCS; most recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://subversion.tigris.org/&#34;&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also used &lt;a href=&#34;http://pvcs.synergex.com/&#34;&gt;PVCS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-01.ibm.com/software/awdtools/clearcase/&#34;&gt;ClearCase&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa302175.aspx#vssmap_topic2&#34;&gt;VSS&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of others (in fact, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn a new source control system every time I&amp;rsquo;ve switched project or company!).  I&amp;rsquo;ve been introduced to &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; over a lunchtime, and I read Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s blog post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VersionControlTools.html&#34;&gt;version control tools&lt;/a&gt;.  The intro provided by FogCreek was spot on for me.  It showed me:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The differences between a DVCS and something like Subversion (OK, specifically svn, which is fine for me);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advantages of using a distributed source control system;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some mindsets that you need to change when switching from svn to a DVCS like &lt;a href=&#34;http://mercurial.selenic.com/&#34;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The FogCreek way of setting up the repositories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The last point was particularly useful in giving some real-life examples of how to use a DVCS and why.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then there was some stuff on why &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/&#34;&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt; might give you more than just the freebie Mercurial install.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was more useful in a general fashion than the FogBugz section.  However, like the FogBugz talk, I got a good feel for the types of teams/companies Kiln might be good for, and why you might use it.  Personally it convinced me that using a DVCS in general is probably better than Subversion (insert usual disclaimer of different tools being appropriate for different situations).  It certainly encourages working practices that will lead to a) less accidental loss of code (after all, that&amp;rsquo;s what source control is for) and b) if well organised, better separation of bugs / features / stories and better integration across versions and branches.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you want to know what I&amp;rsquo;ve been blathering on about in this section, check out Joel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://hginit.com/00.html&#34;&gt;excellent introduction to Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;.  OK, I admit it, I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it all.  But it seems to cover everything that was covered in the conference session, with Joel&amp;rsquo;s usual wit and appeal to the developer mindset.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;In Other News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In terms of an education session, the &amp;ldquo;World Tour&amp;rdquo; was excellent - succinct, easy to digest, and (to my mind) aimed exactly at the audience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;However&lt;/i&gt;.  I actually ended the (half) day being slightly disappointed, and not just because these tools don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be ideal for the Agile team. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get enough of a chance to network.  Now, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to admit this is a problem I regularly have - because, like many developers, I find it difficult to talk to new people in a big room full of people I don&amp;rsquo;t know.  However, given that this was a big room full of developers, I wish there had been more of an effort made to help us to mix and network. Before the talks we were on tables in another room having coffee etc, which I liked because it did lead to some conversation in small groups.  But I would have been nice if there had been a chance at the end of the talks to chat to people and dissect the session (if there actually was, it was so badly publicised I missed it).  I went with a stack of business cards and didn&amp;rsquo;t give a single one out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The half day didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like enough.  But this might be more a reflection of the above point since I got what I wanted from the talks, any more would have been too much info.  So maybe I just wanted more time with the attendees and with the FogCreek guys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was shocked by how few women there were.  I&amp;rsquo;m no tech newbie, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to training sessions, conferences, user groups, seminars, and worked on site at a lot of different types of places.  I was very surprised to see that in a room of several hundred people I counted 5 women (myself included).  This seems low even for gathering of techies, it seems &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; low for a presentation on a piece of software that is effectively project management software.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have the stats to hand, but in my personal experience any technical event with even a sniff of project management stuff is better represented across both genders.  I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally comment on it because it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m used to myself, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked a bunch of times in the last two weeks &amp;ldquo;what do we need to do to encourage more participation by women?&amp;rdquo;, and I have my eyes open for stuff which might help me answer that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A generally good, well-run event, especially as it was free (if I recall correctly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/&#34;&gt;FogBugz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/&#34;&gt;Kiln&lt;/a&gt; are excellent tools for a certain type of organisation / team, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about a small minority of teams here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re Agile, these tools are probably not for you.  You can get them to work, and if you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;kind of&amp;rdquo; agile they&amp;rsquo;re probably better than a lot of your options.  But true agile teams running an effective process might find themselves hindered more than helped.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to download and install a DVCS the very next time I have to write a line of code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CSS for Developers: Horizontal Layout Using CSS</title>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Java Developer.  But I&amp;rsquo;m also a Web Developer.  Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this.  There&amp;rsquo;s some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren&amp;rsquo;t real programmers. Similarly, &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; developers don&amp;rsquo;t like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &amp;ldquo;front end stuff&amp;rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trust me, no-one is going to mistake a Java Developer for a designer.  For a start, when designers wear geeky glasses it&amp;rsquo;s ironic.  Or chic.  Or something.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But developers will be forced to do something around the front end at some point in their lives.  Even if it&amp;rsquo;s because they&amp;rsquo;re sick of manually kicking off some process and want to give the users a big red button to press instead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, as much to compensate for my own goldfish-like brain as anything else, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a note of some of the CSS stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve used or found helpful during my mad scramblings to get the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX Trader&lt;/a&gt; user interface to a) look the way we wanted b) perform fast enough so our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX&#34;&gt;awesome back end performance&lt;/a&gt; wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally invisible to the retail user and c) Not Suck Too Badly in Internet Explorer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Part One: Horizontal Layout (or: There&amp;rsquo;s No Excuse For Tables Any More)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You may (or may not) have heard that using tables for layout is a Bad Thing.  But to be fair, most of us don&amp;rsquo;t care.  I&amp;rsquo;ve done it myself, it&amp;rsquo;s usually the quickest way to lay stuff out on the page, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re new to HTML / CSS and/or short on time.  There are loads of arguments all over the web as to why this is a bad thing, but the reasons I didn&amp;rsquo;t want tables on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; UI was a) we saw the performance improve by a really simple replacement of tables with divs and b) given the amount the UI was mutating, divs positioned with CSS was going to allow us a much quicker turnaround for the umpteenth re-design of the UI (ideally the upshot of this would be letting the designers mess with the CSS when they changed their minds and leave us developers out of it).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway let&amp;rsquo;s assume Tables Are Bad.  Tables are only for tabular data, not for layout.  In my world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.1 Simple Horizontal Layout Using Inline&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most common use of tables for layout is where you put elements side by side - the default behaviour of divs is that they lay out underneath each other.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to get divs to behave this way too, and using divs has some advantages over using tables.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTQhm7XQHTI/AAAAAAAAH7c/3JE1vQBCbgw/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-14+at+17.14.37.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Horizontal flow&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: cyan;&lt;br /&gt;            display: inline;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #center {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: yellow;&lt;br /&gt;            display: inline;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #right {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: red;&lt;br /&gt;            display: inline;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first option is to use &lt;code style=&#34;font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;display: inline&lt;/code&gt;.  This will lay div elements next to each other, similar to a &lt;code style=&#34;font-size: 12px;&#34;&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;.  This is the simplest way to get divs to appear side-by-side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The disadvantage of this technique, however, is that inline elements can&amp;rsquo;t be sized the same way as standard divs.  By default they contract to fit the content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The screenshot above is from Chrome on the mac - you&amp;rsquo;ll notice by default the elements have some spacing between them.  Reducing the margin/borders on the elements doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to eliminate this, so that&amp;rsquo;s something else you might need to consider if you use this mechanism to display elements side-by-side.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.2 Simple Horizontal Layout Using Floats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTQh06-qxcI/AAAAAAAAH7g/5zKQIsKeEdk/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-17+at+10.57.25.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34;

   &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: cyan;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #center {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: yellow;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;        #right {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: red;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;        }&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;container&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Similar to using inline, floating a div will do the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it shrink to fit the content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lay it out side-by-side with any sibling floating divs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll want to apply padding, margins, height, width and whatever else to make it appear less rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br class=&#34;Apple-interchange-newline&#34; /&gt;1.3 Wrapping Horizontal Layout&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_7adQd_YVgmQ/TTQkOi9uxMI/AAAAAAAAH7k/FWxavDriCp0/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-01-17+at+11.12.36.png&#34;

   &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;        #left {&lt;br /&gt;            background-color: cyan;&lt;br /&gt;            width: 50%;&lt;br /&gt;            float: left;&lt;br /&gt;

   &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;left&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Left&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;center&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Center&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;right&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;Right&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The advantage you have using divs over tables is that you can get the browser to work out how the elements should flow.  Tables require you to determine exactly how many cells appear on each row, but with divs you can determine a width for each element and have the browser work out whether to show it on a new line or not.  This will work with both percentage and pixel widths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you want a more table-like structure where you know exactly how many elements should appear on each line, use a percentage of the screen with.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you know the width of each element, you should set a pixel width on the elements and have the browser work out how many to show per line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next CSS post will go over floating behaviour in a little more detail.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;We went live with &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; customers this week just gone.  It&amp;rsquo;s the culmination of nearly two years work for me personally, and three years for our company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs991.snc4/76493_450908175811_545840811_6068221_1642738_n.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to be live at last, and to have our name out there.  It might (in fact, should) change the focus of our work.  Without paying customers it&amp;rsquo;s much more difficult to prioritise work based on what they might need or want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exciting times for LMAX!&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just a summary of the points I took from the Lean conference at Bletchley.  They all need expanding, this is just the stuff that struck me that I want to record.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;A Kanban Multiverse – Karl Scotland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from his talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meaning = visualise; interact; persist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kanban provides the translation between communities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove columns from the Kanban board - no more chucking things over the wall to people&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flip charts for design models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dots on cards for every day in dev, crosses for every day in test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exploration of UI is part of the card&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas applicable for my project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add broken acceptance tests to the Kanban Board?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start doing task breakdowns again&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add issues and impediments to Kanban board?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mingle should be updated to reflect the Kanban, at the moment the states are incorrect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;Converting a Scrum Team to Kanban - Mattias Skarin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from his talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moved from releases per iterations to releases per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shifted motivation from delivering at end of iteration towards delivering quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish release cadence and team rhythm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Root cause analysis to find problems and target them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removed the need for estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas applicable for my project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shift to focus on release cadence from iterations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Product Development in the Land of the Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from their talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goal should be to “Delight Customers”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sitting together decreases waste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sysadmins belong to the team and rotate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deliver value fast enough and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to ask for permission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Learn to Lean: Becoming a Lean Startup – Damon Morgan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from his talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduce a learning culture: blogs, brown bags, conferences&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrum introduces a half-day overhead of planning etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scrum implies a handed off release to QA / Ops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t have “QA” but “Developer/Testers” and “Tester/Developers”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean = planning on demand. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not sure when we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do retrospectives with a pull model?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definition of Done is not only released to production, but has two possibilities: Generating Value and Not Generating Value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cards that are “complete” but not released are inventory (and therefore waste)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need fast smoke tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring allows you to reduce errors and see if the release was good. Auto-rollback if not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Releases can be small, feature-specific releases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have an ideas wall for anyone to contribute&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AB Testing very useful to this organisation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced reliance on estimates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Releases not a big deal – happen daily&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure outcomes, not activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Out of 20 ideas, maybe one works. But cost/benefit clear and well understood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas for us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Become more release-focussed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should we encourage developers to do (more) exploratory testing?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Definition of done should be “released”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better automated monitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Using Kanban to Continuously Improve – Benjamin Mitchel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from his talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quality First&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flow important&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“What wasted your time?” to do root cause analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measure time taken to flow through the board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if you show people metrics they still don&amp;rsquo;t believe you&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas for us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank goodness we&amp;rsquo;re not a big enterprise organisation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Behaviour Driven Development – Liz Keogh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from her talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The term BDD and what it means has solidified over time, but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing new&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concentrate on your riskiest tests first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write your tests starting “should”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversations are around behaviour not tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development of stories is focussed on learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas for us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re pretty good at BDD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Value Stream Languages – Eric Willeke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points from his talk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Really just a summary of the day / Lean&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should respect different languages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break things down into what you need to learn, not what you need to do and how long it will take&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variation comes from time it takes to learn, not time it takes to do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask “what do we need to know that we don&amp;rsquo;t know now?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Break milestones down accordingly – High Learning → High Risk → Core Value → High Value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standup should be phrased “what did we learn yesterday; what do I need to learn today”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your acceleration of learning decreases it might be time to stop designing and start doing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ideas for us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe a shift in thinking about “learning” instead of “doing”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: large;&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: small;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points frequently repeated and/or relevant to my project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim towards no estimation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not focussing on iterations but on releases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Releases are part of the definition of done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our BDD and basic Kanban is pretty good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visibility allows us to find bottlenecks and target them&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focussing on learning might be a path to improvement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Silos are Bad, mmmkay?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I have not (yet) seen the presentation &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.tedneward.com/2009/05/01/On+Speaking+Trolling+Inciting+And+Growing.aspx&#34;&gt;this post &lt;/a&gt;is referring to.  But I think many of the comments Ted makes are very valid, and our industry as a whole should occasionally stop and think.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen Ted speak at QCon, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of time for his comments ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m aware that this blog is rapidly filling with comments about gender and perceptions and people-y stuff, when I originally wanted it to be a purely technical blog.  But I guess this other stuff interests me more.  And there are less people talking about it than there are talking about pure technical solutions to problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Sexism in IT?</title>

            <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/sexism_in_it/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/25/women-it-ada-lovelace&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate our IT women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; knows that there are more men than women in IT.  That it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; job.  Not a lot of people know that the first programmer was a woman.  Not a lot of people realise the number of women in IT is DECREASING.  And has been since the 80s.  In a working world where I honestly believe that &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; there are more opportunities for women (OK, inline with the other stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading I&amp;rsquo;ll caveat this with white, middle-class women), it seems shocking that such a growth industry as IT is actually losing women, and appears unable to determine why, or stop the flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get asked a lot, as a girl programmer, why there aren&amp;rsquo;t more women in IT.  This is a complicated issue and one I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about for years and still don&amp;rsquo;t have any good answers, but I personally think it&amp;rsquo;s more about perception than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s because you get more outright sexism and laddish behaviour in IT than anywhere else.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in half a dozen companies, in a range of industries, including very male industries like manufacturing and banking, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a consultant so been onsite at a bunch more companies.  And I have to say I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen the sort of behaviour that is mentioned in the article. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go so far as to say IT, certainly in terms of programming or IT support, actually attracts men that are quite the opposite to laddish.  So here I will succumb to gross generalisation and stereotypes myself, but the guys I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with are highly intelligent and more likely to rate you on your ability than on your colour, sex or background.  These are often guys who were actually studying at school rather than absorbing anti-female sentiments in the pub or from The Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find being a woman in IT both a blessing and a curse.  As a girl, you are, I believe, more likely to get through to interview, and since you stand out as different are more likely to be remembered and called back for a second interview.  I think once in the organisation, we suffer more with low self-esteem and find ourselves constantly trying to &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; that we&amp;rsquo;re not just some token bimbo hired by HR.  And do you know why?  Not because anyone ELSE thinks that, but because WE think that.  We are our own worst enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to take a leaf from the boys&amp;rsquo; book and have more faith in ourselves, more confidence.  We might not be as good as that person over there at this particular thing, or this other person at something else, but we are good at what we do, otherwise we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there.  And if we express our insecurities instead of our confidence, other people will assume we&amp;rsquo;re as mediocre as we sometimes think we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the very worst culprits for sexism in our industry are us, the girls who are already in it.  Yes, it does exist, I am not denying that for a second&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  But the way to overcome it is to reflect it back at them, not to internalise it as our problem, something wrong with us for being in the wrong job.  The more we show that it&amp;rsquo;s normal for us to be here, that we belong here, the better we&amp;rsquo;ll feel about ourselves.  And maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll attract a few more girls too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;;1&lt;/sup&gt;Take, for example, the CEO who interviewed me and said &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;m probably not allowed to say this, but how will you feel working in an environment full of men&amp;quot;.  To which my answer was, have you read my CV?  I went to a boys&amp;rsquo; school for sixth form, I was one of 6 girls on my degree course (out of approx 150), I worked at Ford for 4 years.  Don&amp;rsquo;t you think I would be more freaked out working with girls?&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Having experience &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html&#34;&gt;Flaccid Scrum&lt;/a&gt;, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&amp;rsquo;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed.  And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge.  In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.  Or just as likely to fail whatever process you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the subject of gender stereotyping, which probably isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising as I&amp;rsquo;m a girl in a predominantly male industry.  And I like cars, and sports, and get irritated if people assume I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;quot;allowed&amp;quot; to be interested in these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far from being discriminated against, however, I find many people ask me why there aren&amp;rsquo;t more women in the industry and what can be done to encourage girls into IT.  If these questions were easy to answer, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But one of my personal theories is around how we raise our children.  Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that girls are genetically, for some reason, averse to technical types of roles.  Or that the working environments don&amp;rsquo;t appeal to the feminine mindset.  But if you tell kids from an early age that some things are for boys and some are for girls, there just aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be enough girls studying &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; subjects later in life to get a large proportion of them into &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot more to say around all these possibilities but I only want to explore one small area today.  I was pointed this morning to an article on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/dec/16/play&#34;&gt;Gender and Toys&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m mainly recording it in here so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget where it is.  But I found it interesting because it raises many of the same questions I have, and answers almost none of them.  At this stage, I think it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to say how much of a child&amp;rsquo;s preferences are there because of parental or peer pressure, and how much is natural.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why a society can discourage the use of words like chairman (preferring &amp;quot;chair&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;chairperson&amp;quot;) and that works hard to at least look like they promote equal opportunities in the workplace, can encourage gender-specific advertising to children (have you watched the adverts between cartoons?) and the &lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&#34;&gt;blatant &lt;/span&gt;gender stereotyping the article talks about in toy stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main point to take out of it, I think, is that we should be aware of how we raise our children.  Well OK so any parent will always want the best for the child and so that&amp;rsquo;s a slightly fatuous statement.  What I mean is, I don&amp;rsquo;t think we should inflict our own preconceptions of what a child will like based purely upon their gender, or they might grow up thinking that really is what they like.  We should be allowed to develop our own preferences and exercise any skills that interest us until we find what really suits us personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS The assumption that Lego is for boys in that article made me very angry.  Of all toys I thought Lego was pretty good at not overtly targeting an audience, although the new trend towards Lego-for-girls has worried me since first saw it.  Lego is for kids!  Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what age or gender they are!&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;How important to you is your working environment? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Type of desk &lt;br /&gt; - What&amp;rsquo;s on it &lt;br /&gt; - Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s) &lt;br /&gt; - Music / background sound (or lack of it) &lt;br /&gt; - Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office &lt;br /&gt; - etc&amp;hellip; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment: &lt;br /&gt; - Eclipse / IntelliJ Idea / Visual Studio (is it still called this?) / other dev enviornment - setup, preferences, window positions &lt;br /&gt; - OS &lt;br /&gt; - Desktop icons - do you care what / how many / positioning &lt;br /&gt; - Which software is always open when you&amp;rsquo;re working, and does it matter what order you open them in (so they&amp;rsquo;re in the correct place on your task bar) (additional: does not having enough RAM cripple you because you have to constantly shut and re-open software?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How anal are you about setting these things up and getting them &lt;em&gt;just right&lt;/em&gt; before you can start coding (or whatever it is you do)? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post comes to you courtesy of my irritation with my chair.  I want to code cross-legged today and my chair does not adjust in the dimension required to provide me with enough space to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I found my own blog useful.  I was configuring Spring validation on my new project, and had to &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/7127.html&#34;&gt;remind myself how to do it&lt;/a&gt;.  We configured validation on the new project in less than an hour, which beats the two days it took me to work out how to do it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I impressed one of my new work collegues.  Apparently I am now the Spring Guru.  Oooops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>On the perils of Front End Design</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/on_the_perils_of_front_end_design/</link>

            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/on_the_perils_of_front_end_design/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://joelonsoftware.com/&#34;&gt;Joel Spolsky&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/User-Interface-Design-Programmers-Spolsky/dp/1893115941/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220319238&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;User Interface Design for Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. A thought that&amp;rsquo;s struck me is about architecture. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get fooled into thinking building software is a bit like being the architect for a building. I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to go into the differences between engineering practices à la building design and good practice software design. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start from the easy point, the stuff you can see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s often a pressure from your designers, from your steering committee, even from your CEO, to make your software look &amp;ldquo;pretty&amp;rdquo;. I, too, with my &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing&#34;&gt;DTP&lt;/a&gt; background, occasionally fall into that camp. You know, slicker fonts, curvy edges, funky this, fancy that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can look at buildings like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nyc-architecture.com/SCC/SCC019.htm&#34;&gt;Woolworth Building&lt;/a&gt;, and think, &amp;ldquo;I want my software to be the equivalent of the Cathedral of Commerce&amp;rdquo;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;margin-bottom: 0in;&#34;&gt;But for all its Gothic detailing, its flying buttresses and gargoyles, you can still find the entrance. You can still find your way to the elevator and up to the floor you desire. The magnificent detail does not obscure the use of the building. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same cannot be said of user interface design. You don&amp;rsquo;t simply wander past / through an impressive facade, whatever you think the &amp;ldquo;skip&amp;rdquo; button on your flash intro is supposed to do. The decoration, the clutter, is right there in front of the user, the whole time they&amp;rsquo;re trying to DO something. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do architects design their entrances flush with the walls and the same colour? &lt;br /&gt;Are entrances to basilicas hidden behind flying buttresses? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No (generally). Because the design of a building is supposed to enhance the &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo;&amp;rsquo;s experience, not get in the way of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re playing with acres of land there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail you can fit in that won&amp;rsquo;t hinder the ordinary person. In fact, rather sadly, many of them won&amp;rsquo;t even notice it. If, however, you&amp;rsquo;re coding for 800x600, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re coding for a wide-screen Mega Television of Doom, there&amp;rsquo;s limited space available. You want to make sure the &amp;ldquo;nice-to-haves&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of the user&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;must-dos&amp;rdquo;. You want to make sure your entrances (buttons, links etc) are well marked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t want to find you&amp;rsquo;ve spent an awful lot of money on &lt;a href=&#34;http://theshapeofdays.com/2004/09/07/the-ryugyong-hotel.html&#34;&gt;something that goes unused&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a lot professionally and personally during my time here in New York, but the time has come to go back &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be relocating to London in September.  I guess it won&amp;rsquo;t hurt to mention on here that I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking for an exciting new job when I get back there.  Check out my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/in/trishagee&#34;&gt;LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; if you are in the market for a Java tech team lead.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the statement that struck me the most when I was on the Certified Scrum Master course was: &lt;em&gt;the start of the project is when you know the least about what you&amp;rsquo;re doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which of course is absolutely true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do we come up with extensive requirements, detailed design, and fixed plans at this point of time?  We haven&amp;rsquo;t put anything into place yet, we haven&amp;rsquo;t played with the code, the customer hasn&amp;rsquo;t seen anything of what we&amp;rsquo;re promising to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we think about it this way, suddenly the waterfall method makes even less sense (assuming people do still like to work this way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many times have you just played with a bit of code, done a prototype, a &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo;, knocked up a basic screen, before you can even give your manager some finger-in-the-air estimates?  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you but I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable unless I have played a bit to get the feel of something before even looking at someone who asks those questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The empirical approach makes a lot more sense to me.  So why aren&amp;rsquo;t we doing it more?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&amp;rsquo;s harder.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s harder because it works, but I daren&amp;rsquo;t make such a bold claim without having a number of such projects under my own belt, or at the very least digging through the web to find examples.  Which frankly I&amp;rsquo;ll leave to you to do, if it matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tales from the Other Side: Confessions of an Offshore Resource</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/tales_from_the_other_side_confessions_of_an_offshore_resource/</link>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented – they agreed to send me to the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I learnt a number of lessons whilst playing this game.  Some of these points are also valid for teams with remote resources (e.g. people working from home).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Time Zone Difference is the First Problem to Overcome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the geographical separation and remote access is important to consider, but it&amp;rsquo;s the time difference which is the killer.  When your working day only (officially) overlaps for 4 hours, you have to make the most of that overlap time.  Some of the steps we took to overcome this were:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moved the daily team meeting from 9.15am GMT to 4pm GMT/11am EST.  Therefore I got to participate in the meeting rather than just having my instructions passed on to me.  This greatly improved communication of issues between all team members, and, more importantly to me, helped me to feel like I was still a part of a team instead of just a resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated the team plan so that instead of simply representing AM/PM activities for all team members, my time was staggered to better represent my working hours.  E.g. Originally the plan looked like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://photos-e.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v241/234/3/545840811/n545840811_836980_6626.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the daily meetings would invariably go something like this:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Lead:&lt;/b&gt;          Ms US Minion, it&amp;rsquo;s Monday 4pm, you must be nearly finished with task 9, right?&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;b&gt;Ms US Minion (Me):&lt;/b&gt;  Dude, it&amp;rsquo;s Monday morning, I&amp;rsquo;ve barely finished checking my e-mail yet, I&amp;rsquo;ve just about glanced at the spec let alone started on the code.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;b&gt;TL:&lt;/b&gt;                 Oh yeah, I forgot.  Well, it&amp;rsquo;ll be done by the end of today, right?&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;b&gt;USM:&lt;/b&gt;                Sure, no problem.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;b&gt;TL:&lt;/b&gt;                 Right, so Bob can kick off the build before he goes home and it&amp;rsquo;ll be sweet by tomorrow morning&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;b&gt;USM:&lt;/b&gt;                Oh wait, you mean the end of YOUR day?  Erm, no, that&amp;rsquo;s not going to happen&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a number of these types of conversations we got bored of forgetting this key point and changed the plan:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://photos-f.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v241/234/3/545840811/n545840811_836981_7204.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Subtle change really, but it was astonishingly useful at helping us to get our heads around when things would be delivered.  If something HAD to be finished before close of business GMT, then it would be clear from the plan if that was achievable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan to use the overlap time to best advantage.  Otherwise something that would have had you waiting for help for an hour or two has you waiting for a day.  I never really got good at this, mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m used to using my mornings for catching up on mail (which was particularly cumbersome when you have nearly a whole day&amp;rsquo;s-worth of UK-based mail to get through), checking out industry news, meetings, phone-calls to the UK etc.  I don&amp;rsquo;t usually get into the coding zone until after lunch.  Unfortunately, by 1pm EST, most of the team is wandering off home and I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten to ask Bob for some pointers on task 10 which I know he&amp;rsquo;s looked at before.  Which means now I have to wait until tomorrow for that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the ways I tried to overcome this problem:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Save non-critical or US-based e-mail replies until the afternoon.  Only deal with the time-critical ones in that early-morning e-mail frenzy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;In your daily TODO list, clearly mark the items which require help from the team and do those in the morning, EVEN IF they&amp;rsquo;re not as &amp;ldquo;important&amp;rdquo; as the other items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;For items scheduled for the afternoon, take a look at them in advance, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just the morning of the same day, ensuring there aren&amp;rsquo;t dependencies on people in the UK.  This is particularly vital for time-critical tasks like releases that need to go out that afternoon.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;What not to do&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop taking lunch.  I fell into this trap to try to increase the overlap time between me and the UK.  At the start of my time here I would not take lunch until the UK had gone home - it felt like using that hour, which falls at the end of the UK day, for “recreation” was a waste, it meant I only had 3 hours overlap with the team (if they all went home on time, and luckily for me they frequently did not).  But, this is a dumb idea.  For a start, the rest of the team frequently did not go home on time, leaving me pining round the office starving to death.  I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who a) likes to take lunch early and b) gets moody and irritable when hungry.  So, for everyone&amp;rsquo;s sanity, it&amp;rsquo;s best if I take lunch.  The second reason this was a poor tactical move is because I was providing second-line support for the application.  So, it was all very well making myself available for the development team in the UK, but if I was away from my desk when they had all gone home, that meant the support guys who needed the development team as second-line support had no-one to turn to if I disappeared.  So, all in all, not a wise course of action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do Not Underestimate How Important Face to Face Contact Is&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It really is.  Well, maybe it’s just me, I’m only writing about my own personal experiences here, and on top of that I am A Girl so maybe we are a different species after all.  But do not neglect this facet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had daily conferences with the team, I was including in all mails, we had a team chat channel and I regularly spoke, in one form or another, to the client and to the support guys.  But all of that cannot replace the inadvertent wince from someone when you talk about some aspect of the system, the tension you can read in someone’s shoulders when you’re talking to them, the cheeky grin or pleading look when someone asks you to do something they know isn’t in your remit but could really use from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was fortunate, because I already personally knew all the people I had to interact with through having been on this project in the UK - it makes it a little easier to judge who they are and how they react to things.  Even so, I found that getting communications without seeing the person put a strain on relationships – it’s so much harder to read a person’s intentions when you can’t see them: to excuse them for being offhand because they seem stressed; to phrase things carefully so as not to upset someone because it looks like it might be a sensitive subject.  That sort of thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also found conferencing into the team meetings a little harder than being there - it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to gauge when to add your piece to a discussion, since you can&amp;rsquo;t see people&amp;rsquo;s faces to see if they&amp;rsquo;re going to say something.  You can&amp;rsquo;t catch someone&amp;rsquo;s eye to see how they feel about something.  You can end up in one of two opposite situations: a) you don&amp;rsquo;t say much, because you don&amp;rsquo;t know when it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to say something, and/or people forget to include you when you&amp;rsquo;re not there, and/or the volume is up too low on the other end for it to be obvious when you want to speak or b) you talk too much – you can&amp;rsquo;t see when people want to interrupt you or add something and/or you can just keep talking loudly and everyone else in the room has to stop and listen to you (unless they hang up on you!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lack of face-to-face contact with the client pretty much ruled out doing any work that required feedback from them.  This will depend upon your client, of course.  In the case of this client, they were very good at responding to well-planned e-mails which asked them to choose a solution from one or more options (provided the implications were well-described).  However &lt;i&gt;getting&lt;/i&gt; to the point where you have enough information to come up with these options and their implications was almost impossible if you didn&amp;rsquo;t sit down in the same room as them and talk things through.  Theoretically this could have been done over the phone, but it almost always needs diagrams and visuals, scribbling on paper and whiteboards etc., making the phone an inappropriate medium.  As a consequence, as soon as I moved offshore, I was no longer involved in any but the most basic requirements gathering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solutions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, there aren’t any really.  You’re not there, you can’t see people.  You can, however, be aware of this situation and work around it.  For example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t expect an offshore resource to be able to gather complex requirements from a client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t expect an offshore resource to be able to explain complex issues / potential solutions to a client.  The client can ignore e-mails they don’t understand and trying to explain over the phone is difficult, and also requires finding a window that fits both schedules and both time zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Team members in all locations need to cut each-other a little slack – try to be precise in communications so that people can’t get hold of the wrong end of the stick, and in return try not to see the worst in someone’s hastily composed e-mail / train-of-consciousness chat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure a regular meeting with a more human element, e.g. conferencing into team meetings.  Interacting in a group like that even if you can’t see people a) helps improve the sense of team and b) provides a bit more context and feedback than simple e-mails or chat.  If you can get a video conference, even if rarely, that will help.  I can have very visual thought-processes, and something I did to help the team to think of me as a person and not just a voice or a spam-bot is to take photos of me in my working environment, and to take the team on a web-cam tour of the US office.  In return, they shared photos of the new office they had moved to since my relocation to the US.  It was fun, and helped us to connect on a more human level.&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication is, unsurprisingly, the key to productive working when the team is geographically split.  The processes we put into place to help enable this were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily team meeting for the development team, at a time when all members can participate and providing facilities for all members to participate, remotely or locally (e.g. conference call).  This is not just to enable communication amongst the team, but also to help offsite resources to feel a part of the team – a little “chat time” in this meeting, rather than being all work, is fundamental for remembering we’re all human, blowing off a little steam, and generally bonding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weekly team meeting for development team plus client plus support team, again providing a way for everyone to participate.  This allows us all to swap ideas and issues regardless of where we are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work needs to be allocated at least 24 hours in advance.  This works both ways - it cannot be expected that if I’m asked to do something as the UK team goes home, they expect it complete (or even started!) by the time they get in the next day – I might need support from the team, or from other people in that time zone.  Similarly, I can&amp;rsquo;t fling stuff back to the UK at the end of my working day and expect it to be worked on by the time I get in the next day, as they might have questions for me.  And I personally get grumpy when woken up at 4am by a phone call.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;A project plan needs to be kept up-to-date and visible to all team members.  This plan is better if it clearly represents the time zone differences between team members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although ideally all team members should be treated equally, limitations of remote-working need to be considered when allocating work – any task which requires extensive support from the rest of the team or close relations with the client is probably not appropriate for someone who doesn’t work in the same location or the same hours as the team and client.&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was lucky:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I had a team I knew and a client I knew on a product I was familiar with (although I had to learn a LOT more in order to support it independently during the afternoons).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK team were workaholics and generally provided more of an overlap with my working day than I think is healthy for a bunch of 20-something males.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The UK Team Lead went above and beyond, being accessible by phone until about midnight GMT (7pm EST).  I tried not to abuse this but it definitely helped resolve pressing issues instead of having to wait another day.  In return, where possible I would check my mail and chat, however briefly, when I got up so I had a quick heads-up of the state of play at mid-morning GMT, well before I got into work.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, I was a senior developer who had also had experience leading the UK team and gathering client requirements so I had a good view of the bigger picture of the project.  So sometimes this meant I would irritatingly question every piece of work I was allocated and be nosy about the motivations behind something, but it also meant that I had the knowledge and ability to work pretty independently from the rest of the team.  This may not apply to all offshore / remote resources.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Defect-Black-Market.aspx&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of what happens when you try to incentivise intelligent people on very simple metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was well described in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/product-description/006073132X&#34;&gt;Freakonomics&lt;/a&gt;, and something &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/AboutMe.html&#34;&gt;Mr On Software&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html&#34;&gt;bangs on about regularly&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s clear that there isn&amp;rsquo;t really a good answer to the problem - actually that&amp;rsquo;s not true.  The answer to the problem is to have everyone working in a job they are happy in and proud of, one where they are intrinsically motivated, and give them enough information to allow them to make the correct calls when it comes to prioritising work.  But I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that a large portion of the working world does not fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Certification</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/certification/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/certification/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;I know there are arguments against certification, and I definitely think that using &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/3139.html&#34;&gt;certifiction&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether to interview or recruit people is downright daft, because frankly learning a bunch of answers isn&amp;rsquo;t all that difficult.  But I personally find that completing a certification really helps to round out my knowledge in an area.  I guess my thoughts are that a fairly recent certification combined with the work experience to back it up is something that would make your CV more interesting to recruiters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has worked more on web apps than &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; Java applications, I found the 1.5 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/scjp.xml&#34;&gt;SCJP&lt;/a&gt; dead useful for drumming into me the facts about threading etc that I don&amp;rsquo;t usually think too much about.  Plus since I did it very shortly after 1.5 started being used in anger, it was a good way to get familiar with the new features.  Although honestly it could&amp;rsquo;ve banged on a bit less about Generics, the stuff that was in the exam I have never used in real life.  Well, maybe once, and even then I looked it up on the internet to remember how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/scwcd.xml&#34;&gt;SCWCD&lt;/a&gt; now, I figured I might as well &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; I can do all the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing for close on a decade now (if you count the fumblings of my third year project as web development).  It&amp;rsquo;s full of what &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.randsinrepose.com&#34;&gt;Rands&lt;/a&gt; calls &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2002/07/10/the_dark_underbelly_of_holy_shit.html&#34;&gt;Holy Shit&lt;/a&gt; moments.  Now, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m a damned good web developer (no, really, it&amp;rsquo;s true!!) but reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/3139.html&#34;&gt;the book&lt;/a&gt;, having it explain some of the things I always took for granted, or stuff I ALWAYS have to look up because I can never remember exactly how it works, is filling in a lot of gaps.  It also explained to me WHY I never really worry too much about thread safety - I&amp;rsquo;m already unconciously designing for it and more, by coding in as stateless a fasion as I can, something you really have to try to do in web development.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it will make me a better web developer, even if it is banging on about some of the Ancient (un)Holy Ways of JSP &amp;amp; Servlets which has been almost entirely replaced with using frameworks like Spring MVC or Struts (to their credit, although the authors have to teach The Old Ways they do keep pointing out this is not the way to do things these days).  In fact, in a few simple sentences, they explained to me why I was having a recurring nasty problem on the last web app I worked on, which I was blaming on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensymphony.com/sitemesh/&#34;&gt;Sitemesh&lt;/a&gt;.  Poor Sitemesh, how I have maligned you - it was not your fault at all, it was my abuse of the &amp;lt;jsp:include&amp;gt; tag (although frankly the fact that I HAD to use a &amp;lt;jsp:include&amp;gt; tag in the first place should probably have told me that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using the correct tool for the job, Sitemesh really is not a lightweight &lt;a href=&#34;http://tiles.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Tiles&lt;/a&gt; and clearly should not be used as such).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s at times like these that I realise what my real skill is - cramming my brain with as much pertinent information as possible for short-term retention, and recalling it in high pressure environments.  It&amp;rsquo;s why my GCSE results are so great.  It&amp;rsquo;s probably also what makes me good consultant material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the information even sticks in there.  Just ask me how oxbow lakes are created and I&amp;rsquo;ll prove it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AOP Caching</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/aop_caching/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/aop_caching/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to document my experiences implementing caching with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) and annotations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background context&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you. Implementing a home-grown cache from scratch is almost never the correct thing to do in my experience, you spend lots of time debugging and tweaking the cache when you should be working on your day-job, not re-inventing something that &lt;a href=&#34;http://java-source.net/open-source/cache-solutions&#34;&gt;someone, somewhere, has already done a perfectly good job of&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The example I&#39;m about to show you is for a web application created to let users read and edit values from a database (not an unusual scenario!).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application Architecture&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The application architecture I have assumed for this example is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Java 1.5, JSP, Spring MVC (2.0.1), Spring JDBC (2.0.4), running on Tomcat 5.5, connecting to a database (RDBMS type not important for this example).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OSCache&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;A third party library, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensymphony.com/oscache/&#34;&gt;OSCache&lt;/a&gt;, provides the underlying cache for the application. This was chosen because it provides a simple solution which is easy to integrate into our Spring MVC layer and also provides JSP-level caching should we need it later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application uses OSCache in a very basic way. Caching could&#39;ve been implemented with a HashMap and it wouldn’t have provided much less functionality (the way I&#39;m using it), but by using OSCache we can using the &#34;group&#34; functionality (which allows us to cache against a key AND a group name, so we can flush and reload a whole group if necessary), and we can potentially add timeouts and other more complex functionality simply with configuration changes. See the OSCache documentation for full details.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CacheManager&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Primarily to aid unit testing, but also to provide some separation between the application and the implementation of the caching mechanism, a CacheManager interface was implemented, and the implementation version simply wraps the OSCache GeneralCacheAdministrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect Oriented Programming for Caching&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;If caching is implemented in a very simple way, it can be easy to forget to handle caching on all methods that require it. Also, the code to check something is in the cache and retrieve it from the database and store it in the cache if it is not, is standard for most functions. Therefore it seemed to make sense to implement caching using Aspect Oriented Programming, so it can cut across all functionality without it having to be explicitly declared in every method that might need to utilise the cache.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spring has &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.1/reference/aop.html&#34;&gt;built-in support for AOP&lt;/a&gt; (and that documentation also provides a good introduction to what AOP is), so given our use of Spring MVC it shouldn&#39;t be too complicated to add Aspects to our code.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Implementation: Application Context file&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;You need to add a couple of things to the application context file for your app to set up the cache and enable the AOP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Initialisation for Caching --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;!-- the actual cache --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;bean&amp;nbsp;id=&#34;cacheAdministrator&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; class=&#34;com.opensymphony.oscache.general.GeneralCacheAdministrator&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; destroy-method=&#34;destroy&#34;/&amp;gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&#34;cacheManager&#34; class=&#34; com.mechanitis.examples.cache.impl.CacheManagerImpl&#34;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;property name=&#34;cacheAdministrator&#34; ref=&#34;cacheAdministrator&#34;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Magic to get the Spring aspectJ-style AOP working --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;aop:aspectj-autoproxy /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Code that does the caching (the Aspect) --&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;bean&amp;nbsp;id=&#34;cacheAOP&#34; class=&#34;com.mechanitis.examples.aspect.CachingAspects&#34;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;property name=&#34;cache&#34; ref=&#34;cacheManager&#34; /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;!-- End of Caching setup --&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that, like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/7127.html&#34;&gt;validation&lt;/a&gt;, this makes use of schema-based configuration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now these settings are in the configuration file, they should not need to be changed unless the cache provider is changed or caching is to be fundamentally altered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Implementation: Defining Items to be Cached&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I had the application &#34;magically&#34; caching anything returned from a “get” method in the service layer and purging the cache on any “save” or “update” method.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However there are some types of objects that don’t need to be cached and cause errors when they do, as sometimes the data needs to be &#34;fresh&#34; from the database. So the service layer declares what needs attention from the cache manager by the use of annotations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;import com.mechanitis.examples.cache.Cache;&lt;br/&gt;// ...more imports...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;public class CustomerServiceImpl implements CustomerService {&lt;br/&gt;	private static final String CUSTOMER_CACHE_GROUP = &#34;Customer&#34;;&lt;br/&gt;	private static final String BRANCH_CACHE_GROUP = &#34;Branch&#34;;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	private CustomerDAO customerDAO;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	@Cache(groups=CUSTOMER_CACHE_GROUP)&lt;br/&gt;	public Client getCustomer(CustomerId customerId) {&lt;br/&gt;		return customerDAO.getCustomer(customerId);&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	@Cache(groups=CUSTOMER_CACHE_GROUP)&lt;br/&gt;	public ClientId saveCustomer(Customer customer, String username) {&lt;br/&gt;		return customerDAO.saveCustomer(customer, username);&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	@Cache(groups=CUSTOMER_CACHE_GROUP)&lt;br/&gt;	public void updateCustomer(Customer customer) {&lt;br/&gt;		this.customerDAO.updateCustomer(customer);&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	@Cache(groups={CUSTOMER_CACHE_GROUP,BRANCH_CACHE_GROUP})&lt;br/&gt;	public void saveCustomerBranch(CustomerBranch customerBranch) {&lt;br/&gt;		customerDAO.saveCustomerBranch (customerBranch);&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may notice that this service doesn’t really add much value – it forwards the request to the DAO and little else. The purpose of the service layer, however, is to provide a simple place for things like caching, and in future potentially additional security, logging, transactions, or to string together multiple calls to DAOs for a more complex transaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The methods that return objects that need to be cached or that affect items in the cache are tagged with the @Cache &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html&#34;&gt;annotation&lt;/a&gt;. The single argument to this is a list of the groups in the cache that the Object should be or already is associated with. This group allows selective flushing of the cache – so when a new Customer is added, only the Customer group gets flushed (and consequently refreshed) rather than the whole cache.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that these annotations have to be on the implementation class of the service layer, not the interface – this is because it&#39;s the implementation that is wrapped by the AOP proxy. For more information see &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.1/reference/aop.html#aop-understanding-aop-proxies&#34;&gt;Understanding AOP Proxies&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Implementation: CachingAspects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This class is responsible for most of the work around the caching mechanism. It defines which methods in the service layer require attention from the caching mechanism and it performs the work around retrieving from the cache and dealing with cache misses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses the AspectJ AOP conventions in Spring 2.0, more information of which can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/aop.html#aop-ataspectj&#34;&gt;Spring documentation&lt;/a&gt;. The main areas of interest are the annotations for each method which state when this method is to be called: &lt;pre&gt;@Around(&#34;execution(@com.mechanitis.examples.cache.Cache java.util.List get* ())&#34;)&lt;br/&gt;public Object cacheListWithNoArgs(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {...}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This states that this method should be called when any method that starts with the word &#34;get&#34; that returns a List and is tagged with the @Cache annotation is called. The @Around states that this method will be responsible for calling the original method – so in this case the original service method that was called (e.g. CustomerService.getAllCustomers()) will only be called if the list not is found in the cache. Another example is: &lt;pre&gt;@Around(&#34;execution(@com.mechanitis.examples.cache.Cache “&lt;br/&gt;		+ &#34; com.mechanitis.examples.common.domain.* &#34;&lt;br/&gt;		+ &#34;get* (com.mechanitis.examples.domain.id.*))&#34;)&lt;br/&gt;public Object getIdentifiableObject(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {...}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method is called when a service method is called that is tagged with the @Cache annotation, starts with “get”, is passed a domain ID and returns a domain object. This is a classic example of something to be dealt with by the cache manager – again it needs to check if the item is in the cache, return it if it is or retrieve it from its original source and store it in the cache if it is not. You can have similar methods for determining which methods need to flush the cache (e.g. &#34;update&#34; or &#34;create&#34; methods).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey presto! An almost magical cache which does not require your developers to re-write the same caching code for all the &#34;get&#34;, &#34;update&#34; and &#34;create&#34; methods on your service layer. All they have to do is tag the appropriate methods with @Cache and the AOP will take care of the rest of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages to AOP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;As with many “magical” implementations, the main issue I found with this implementation of an AOP cache is that it can be difficult to debug. Caching can cause weird issues anyway (for example, if your update methods don’t correctly flush the cache you get old data being displayed, or if your cache update method doesn’t correctly retrieve the data). But when you throw Aspects into the mix, it can cause some interesting bugs that are hard to track down.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one key to helping to overcome this issue is a good set of unit/functional tests for your cache. The advantage of testing a centralised AOP cache is that you don’t have to thoroughly test every method that might have caching implemented. So writing a lot of good tests for the AOP cache probably pays off vs. implementing and testing caching for individual methods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, strange things can creep in that can’t be detected by unit tests. For example, if a method has been tagged as a cache method through careless copy-paste coding, when it needs real-time data. Or, as I found, worse – if you don’t have a way to explicitly state which methods require caching but do it through the magic of naming conventions, you need all your developers to be fully aware of these conventions (and to not make mistakes in this area) in order to state which methods use the cache and which do not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I probably spent more time tweaking and debugging the cache than almost any other individual area of the application when I used it in anger, I would still say it was worthwhile implementing it in this fashion. The benefits from removing any “difficult” bits from the service layer, so junior developers can happily work, and the ease of adding an annotation to the appropriate methods, I think improved productivity enough and allowed for much cleaner code (which also improves productivity) so that it was the right choice to make.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmm.  I have been so busy trying to think of &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; things to write here, and not having the time to actually write, that I see it&amp;rsquo;s been 6 months since the last post.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If anyone is still out there though, I need help.  I need a good Certified Scrum Master course in New York or London, preferably in April or May.  Any suggestions?  The one I wanted to go on was vetoed and now I find it&amp;rsquo;s not running in NY again until Autumn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS Do you think it would be inappropriate to use the term &amp;ldquo;Scrum Mistress&amp;rdquo; on my CV?&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Validation with Spring Modules Validation</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/validation_with_spring_modules_validation/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/validation_with_spring_modules_validation/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;So if java generics slightly &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanitis.livejournal.com/6783.html&#34;&gt;disappointed me lately&lt;/a&gt;, what have I found cool?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a web application using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.org/docs/reference/mvc.html&#34;&gt;Spring MVC&lt;/a&gt;, which probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t come as a big surprise, it seems to be all the rage these days.  Since this is my baby, I got to call the shots as to a lot of the framework choices.  When it came to looking at implementing validation, I refused to believe I&amp;rsquo;d have to go through the primitive process of looking at all the values on the request and deciding if they pass muster, with some huge &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.  Even with Spring&amp;rsquo;s rather marvelous &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/validation.html&#34;&gt;binding and validation mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to take the worst of the tasks off you, it still looked like it would be a bit of a chore.  Given all the cool things you can do with AOP etc I figured someone somewhere must&amp;rsquo;ve implemented an annotations-based validation plugin for Spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.8/html_single/#validation&#34;&gt;And they have&lt;/a&gt;.  And there&amp;rsquo;s actually a reasonable amount of information about how to set it up and get it working.  The problem is that it&amp;rsquo;s pretty flexible and has a lot of different options, so when you are running Java 1.5 and Spring 2.0, and actually want to use the validation in a simple, straightfoward fashion, the setup instructions get lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s my record so I don&amp;rsquo;t forget in future how I did it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a brief summary for those who may not be familiar with Spring, or for those who need reminding (no doubt me in a few months when I&amp;rsquo;ve completely forgetten what I was working on), Spring provides a &lt;code&gt;Validator&lt;/code&gt; interface that you can use to easily plug validation into your application.  In the context of web applications, you create your various &lt;code&gt;Validators&lt;/code&gt; and in your application context XML file you tell your Controllers to use those validators on form submission (for example).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spring Modules validation provides a bunch of generic validation out of the box for all the tedious, standard stuff - length validation, mandatory fields, valid e-mail addresses etc (&lt;a href=&#34;https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.8/html_single/#d0e8935&#34;&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;).  And you can plug this straight into your application by using annotations.  How?  Easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my outline application context file:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;beans xmlns=&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&#34;&gt;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;	xmlns:xsi=&amp;quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;	xmlns:vld=&amp;quot;http://www.springmodules.org/validation/bean/validator &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;	xsi:schemaLocation=&amp;quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd&#34;&gt;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;						http://www.springmodules.org/validation/bean/validator &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springmodules.org/validation/bean/validator.xsd&amp;amp;quot;&#34;&gt;http://www.springmodules.org/validation/bean/validator.xsd&amp;amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;vld:annotation-based-validator id=&amp;quot;validator&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; Load messages &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;messageSource&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;		class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;basenames&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;messages,errors&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash; Bean initialisation for validation. You can put these explicitly into your controllers or set to autowire by name or type &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;messageCodesResolver&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;		class=&amp;quot;org.springmodules.validation.bean.converter.ModelAwareMessageCodesResolver&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;lt;/beans&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really all you&amp;rsquo;re interested in is the addition of the validation namespace and schema at the top of the file, and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;vld:annotation-based-validator id=&amp;quot;validator&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line which is your actual validator.  The other sections are a message source so your error codes can have meaningful messages and a MessageCodeResolver to make use of these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eclipse does seem to moan about the way the springmodules schema is referenced, but when you actually start Tomcat up it seems happy enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to give the validator the ID &lt;code&gt;validator&lt;/code&gt; because I turned autowire by name on so that all my controllers picked up this validation by default.  Note: autowire can be a little bit dangerous and I&amp;rsquo;ve actually turned it off now because I had a &lt;code&gt;validator&lt;/code&gt; bean and a &lt;code&gt;validators&lt;/code&gt; list in the context file and my poor SimpleFormController controllers were getting a bit confused over which one to use (in truth, the single validator was overwriting the list, which was not what I was after at all).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway.  Now what?  We have a validator and we&amp;rsquo;ve probably wired it into the relevant controllers, either by autowiring them or poking it specifically into our controllers like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;somePersonController&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;		class=&amp;quot;com.mechanitis.examples.validation.controller.MyPersonController&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;commandClass&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;			value=&amp;quot;com.mechanitis.examples.validation.command.PersonCommand&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;formView&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;person&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;successView&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;success&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;		&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;validator&amp;quot; ref=&amp;quot;validator&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next step is to add some validation rules.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.8/html_single/#d0e8930&#34;&gt;The documentation&lt;/a&gt; will show you how to do this using an XML file, which you&amp;rsquo;re perfectly welcome to do.  However what I wanted to show is how to use annotations on your command object to declare your validation.  So here you are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;import org.springmodules.validation.bean.conf.loader.annotation.handler.CascadeValidation;&lt;br/&gt;import org.springmodules.validation.bean.conf.loader.annotation.handler.Email;&lt;br/&gt;import org.springmodules.validation.bean.conf.loader.annotation.handler.Length;&lt;br/&gt;import org.springmodules.validation.bean.conf.loader.annotation.handler.Min;&lt;br/&gt;import org.springmodules.validation.bean.conf.loader.annotation.handler.NotNull;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;public class PersonCommand {&lt;br/&gt;    private static final int NAME_MAX_LENGTH = 50;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    @NotNull&lt;br/&gt;    @Length(min = 1, max = NAME_MAX_LENGTH)&lt;br/&gt;    private String name;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    @Min(value=1)&lt;br/&gt;    private Long age;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;    @Email&lt;br/&gt;    private String eMail;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    @CascadeValidation&lt;br/&gt;    private RelationshipCommand relationship = new RelationshipCommand();&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    private String action;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    //insert getters and setters etc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;@CascadeValidation&lt;/code&gt; tells the validator to run validation on the enclosed secondary Command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just a simple example obviously.  But hopefully you can see that now you&amp;rsquo;ve got the validator set up correctly in your application context file, all you need to cover 90% of your validation needs is to tag the relevant fields with the type of validation you want.  If you want to get really clever, the validator supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://springmodules.dev.java.net/docs/reference/0.8/html_single/#valang&#34;&gt;Valang&lt;/a&gt; which allows you to write simple rules.  For example, if I only want to validate the name when I&amp;rsquo;m saving the person rather than passing the command around for some other purpose, I might change the annotations on the name field:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    @NotNull(applyIf=&amp;quot;action EQUALS &amp;lsquo;savePerson&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;    @Length(min = 1, max = NAME_MAX_LENGTH, applyIf=&amp;quot;action EQUALS &amp;lsquo;savePerson&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot;)&lt;br/&gt;    private String name;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the basics.  Before I let you go off and play though, a word about error messages.  As usual with Spring validators, you can specify pretty messages to be displayed to the user when things go wrong.  In my application context file above you should see that I&amp;rsquo;ve specified a properties file called errors.  In this file you can map your error codes to the message to display.  When using the spring modules validation I found the error codes generated were like the ones below so you might have an errors.properties file that looks like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# *** Errors for the Person screens&lt;br/&gt;PersonCommand.age[min]=An age should be entered&lt;br/&gt;PersonCommand.name[length]=Person name should be between 1 and 50 characters&lt;br/&gt;# etc etc&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;# *** General errors&lt;br/&gt;not.null=This field cannot be empty&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go play.&lt;/p&gt;

            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_specifics/</link>
            <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/java_specifics/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/generics.html&#34;&gt;generics&lt;/a&gt; were the best thing since sliced bread.  No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html&#34;&gt;new for loop&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider the old code:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	    List list = new ArrayList();&lt;br/&gt;	    list.add(new Integer(1));&lt;br/&gt;	    Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	    for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {&lt;br/&gt;	    	Integer number = (Integer)i.next();&lt;br/&gt;	    	number.intValue();&lt;br/&gt;	    }&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the new:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	    List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; list = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;	    list.add(new Integer(2));&lt;br/&gt;	    Integer integer = list.get(0);&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	    for (Integer number : list) {&lt;br/&gt;	    	number.intValue();&lt;br/&gt;	    }&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See?  Much prettier.  OK so it&amp;rsquo;s a silly little example but when you apply it to all the places you use things like Collections it does make life a lot easier, especially when you consider that now you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what&amp;rsquo;s in that List that comes back from some method that you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearly two years on from the first time I started using them, I run into an issue - they&amp;rsquo;re not generic at all.  They&amp;rsquo;re specific.  The point about generics as far as I can figure out is type-safety - they remove the need to cast everything everywhere.  Which is great, until you actually want a little flexibility in your types.  So, you can have the code above which adds and retrieves Integers from a list, knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine to get objects from that list and treat them as Integers because that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what they are.  But what you can&amp;rsquo;t do is assign a List of some subtype to a List of one if its supertypes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	public List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; getIntegers() {&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; integers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;		integers.add(new Integer(1));&lt;br/&gt;		return integers;&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;hellip;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	public void assignList() {&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;Number&amp;gt; numbers = getIntegers(); //compiler error - Type mismatch&lt;br/&gt;		//or&lt;br/&gt;		numbers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;(); //compiler error - Type mismatch&lt;br/&gt;	}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK fine, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit confusing but it makes sense if you think about it.  A good example is provided in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp01255.html&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which explains that if you&amp;rsquo;re expecting a Collection of Numbers, you might expect to be able to add a Float to it, but if lurking under the covers you&amp;rsquo;ve assigned a List of Integers to it, it is incorrect to add a Float to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what about wildcards?  Aren&amp;rsquo;t they supposed to overcome this issue?  Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netalive.org/swsu/archives/2005/07/generics_wildca.html&#34;&gt;sort of&lt;/a&gt;.  Wildcards in generics means you can do the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;? extends Number&amp;gt; numbers = getIntegers();&lt;br/&gt;		//or&lt;br/&gt;		numbers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and this will not give a compiler error.  But then you can&amp;rsquo;t do:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;? extends Number&amp;gt; numbers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;		numbers.addAll(new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;()); //compiler error&lt;br/&gt;		numbers.add(new Integer(1)); //compiler error&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So you can use a wildcarded Collection to represent that you know that Collection is going to be some Collection that contains something that is a subclass of Number (for example), but not to say that the Collection can contain any mix of items that are a sublasses of number.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OK&amp;hellip; what do I need to remember to prevent confusion in future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, looks like we use:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;Number&amp;gt; numbers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Number&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;		numbers.add(new Integer(1));&lt;br/&gt;		numbers.add(new Double(1));&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;if you want your collection to contain a mix of items that are subclasses of your specified generic type.  But you might have to use something like &lt;code&gt;addAll&lt;/code&gt; to insert the contents of some other List into it, as you can&amp;rsquo;t assign Lists of subclasses to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to assign Lists that have a generic type that&amp;rsquo;s a subclass, then you want to use wildcards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;		List&amp;lt;? extends Number&amp;gt; numbers = getIntegers();&lt;br/&gt;		//or&lt;br/&gt;		numbers = new ArrayList&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt;();&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, easy then.  No idea what I got so confused about.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t a shame that actual day-to-day work always seems to get in the way of progress?  How you&amp;rsquo;re always too busy fire-fighting to actually perform the critical thing that might actually improve affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this is basically a setup for a roundabout excuse for why this blog has been neglected so shortly after it was begun.  I was a bit too busy doing the day job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, people like &lt;a href=&#34;http://livejournal.com/users/joelonsoftware&#34;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://livejournal.com/usres/dilbert_blog&#34;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; manage regular pronouncements and I&amp;rsquo;m sure they&amp;rsquo;re much busier than I!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Agile Infection Growing</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/agile_infection_growing/</link>
            <pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/agile_infection_growing/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mikemason.ca/2007/03/21/#20070321CardInfected&#34;&gt;This is a bloody good idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It builds upon my own Virgoen tendancies to write lists and tick things off, but what the list
model lacks is the &amp;ldquo;in progress&amp;rdquo; state.  Plus occasionally my lists get confused.  See today&amp;rsquo;s
notebook page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;form&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Thursday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Fix bugs in Test Director&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Merge fixes up&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Do build&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;true&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Merge down&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Read terms of contract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;E-mail solicitor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Go to Robert Dyas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;true&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Order DAB Radio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Finish business analysis docs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34;/&gt;Carry on with QCon note consolidation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do I know which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve started?  I could do with a couple of boards at least as well to separate the personal from the business.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also note that I took something away from my Time Management course, attended when I was a mere graduate at a large manufacturing organisation: make a new list for each day, discarding your completed items and moving forward the incomplete ones (it also mentions to discard &amp;ldquo;low priority&amp;rdquo; items that haven&amp;rsquo;t been done over a week or two under the theory that you&amp;rsquo;ll never do it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t by then).  This is great for keeping a nice clean list of achievable goals for the day, but a bit rubbish at giving any positive feedback - no matter how much you get done, every day there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;span style=&#34;font-style: italic;&#34;&gt;yet more &lt;/span&gt;to do, and lack of visibility on what you have actually achieved. The example story wall in the link above is great for a sense of acheivement - yes there&amp;rsquo;s still things to be done but look how much has been achieved in comparison!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, I am going to make the common criticism of cards: one of their major advantages, their &amp;ldquo;physicality&amp;quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is also the disadvantage - whilst I can take my little notebook round with me, I can&amp;rsquo;t lug a story wall between work and home.  And although some of those things are personal tasks, they need to be done at work (e.g. e-mailing because I haven&amp;rsquo;t got my broadband at home yet) or between work and home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mind you, I actually have 3 pieces of paper containing lists of things to do / buy / check / clean with regards to my new flat, because of my inability to actually carry the notebook with me.  Or the same one at least.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this means two more items to be added to the &amp;ldquo;To Buy&amp;rdquo; list: a magnetic whiteboard and some story cards.  I like whiteboards because you can even scribble stuff behind / around the cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT: Bah, someone else &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/jatLetsGetOrganized.htm&#34;&gt;already beat me to it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This is an extract from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/stories.html&#34;&gt;James Shore&amp;rsquo;s section on Stories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Write stories on index cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the result of some strange Ludditian urge on the part of XP&amp;rsquo;s creators—it&amp;rsquo;s a deliberate choice based on the strengths of the medium. You see, physical cards have one feature that no conglomeration of pixels has: you can pick them up and move them around. They&amp;rsquo;re tactile. This gives them power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;there are a number of points in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/articles/paul-oldfield-interview&#34;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with Paul Oldfield which are interesting to consider when thinking about &amp;ldquo;doing Agile right&amp;rdquo;.  It seems to be compatible with my &amp;ldquo;people over process&amp;rdquo; view - I&amp;rsquo;m not stating that having good people negates the need for any form of process or discipline, I have seen that this is simply not the case.  I do however think that agile techniques in particular rely heavily upon the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; people / team, for some nebulous definition of  &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>QCon London</title>
            <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/qcon_london/</link>
            <pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
            
            <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/qcon_london/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://qcon.infoq.com/qcon/conference/&#34;&gt;QCon London&lt;/a&gt;
conference, an event &amp;ldquo;designed with the technical depth and enterprise focus of interest to
technical team leads, architects, and project managers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference consisted of two days of tutorials followed by three days of talks covering
technologies, vendor products, and processes.  In addition there were numerous &amp;ldquo;networking&amp;rdquo;
opportunities with plenty of break times to both absorb information and meet other people, plus
evening events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was both comprehensive and absorbing, and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to take the next few days to
filter through the notes I have taken and present a more succinct version here.  Whether it will
be of use to anyone other than myself remains to be seen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
