      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know that Code Reviews are a Good Thing. We probably have our own personal lists of things we
 look for in the code we review, while also fearing what others might say about our code. How to
 we ensure that code reviews are actually benefiting the team, and the application? How do we
 decide who does the reviews? What does &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this talk, Trisha will identify some best practices to follow. She&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s
really important in a code review, and set out some guidelines to follow in order to maximise the
 value of the code review and minimise the pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Year? Really?</title>

      <description>So I came to the blog to update my upcoming events (at least something stays up to date) only to find it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly a year since I last blogged! This is terrible!
It&amp;rsquo;s not that I haven&amp;rsquo;t written anything in a year, it&amp;rsquo;s that a lot of my writing energy goes into stuff for the actual day job. Which is good, because that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much what I wanted from the day job, but the blog makes it look like I don&amp;rsquo;t write any more.</description>
