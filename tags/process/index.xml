      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I walked into the kitchen to see how lunch was going and my boyfriend handed me a knife,
a part-chopped hard boiled egg and said &amp;ldquo;finish this, I need to have a shower&amp;rdquo;. As you do. Apparently there were two things that needed
doing - &amp;ldquo;this&amp;rdquo; needed finishing, and I needed to keep an eye on the fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>One of the most obvious differences I faced when I moved from LMAX to 10gen were the working conditions. I don&#39;t mean like being deep underground in some dangerous situation vs being pampered by beautiful slave boys and girls. What I mean is that the working practices at one company necessitated being in the office for core hours, and at the other flexible hours and remote-working are practically mandatory. At at LMAX we pair-programmed most days, and that meant that being co-located: being in the same office, at the same computer, was pretty important.</description>

      <description>After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented â€“ they agreed to send me to the US.To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.</description>
