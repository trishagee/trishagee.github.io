      <description>Last week (was it only last week?) I was at Strange Loop, presenting a workshop on the Disruptor.I didn&#39;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&#39;ve never been before and, if I&#39;m honest, hadn&#39;t heard of it before. So everything was a pleasant surprise.It&#39;s a very geeky conference. I mean that as a compliment, of course. Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&#39;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.</description>
