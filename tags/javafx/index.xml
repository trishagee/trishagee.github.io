      <title>Fully Reactive: Spring, Kotlin, JavaFX, and MongoDB Playing Together</title>

      <description>Spring Framework 5 brings full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive programming than to actually build something live? This sessionâ€™s presenters perform a daring feat of pair programming/dueling coding to create an end-to-end application by using Spring Framework 5, Spring Boot, Reactor, Kotlin, JavaFX, REST, and MongoDB, all built with IntelliJ IDEA. What could possibly go wrong?</description>

      <description>On the same day Stephen Chin came to see me at the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. &amp;nbsp;Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.
Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.</description>
