      <title>Fully Reactive: Spring, Kotlin, and JavaFX Playing Together</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Framework 5 brings full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive
programming than to actually build something live? Trisha will live code an end-to-end application using Spring
Framework 5, Spring Boot, Reactor, Kotlin, JavaFX, and maybe even some MongoDB, all built using IntelliJ IDEA. 
During this session, weâ€™ll see how these different components can work together really easily using Spring. What
could possibly go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>On the same day Stephen Chin came to see me at the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.
Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.</description>
