All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#. Easy, right?
Trisha&rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward. Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:

        What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

      If you see anything about LMAX - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&rsquo;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. However, no-one&rsquo;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. And I realised eventually that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.

      As a survival trait for living and working in the cites1 of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers. If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is. Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.
So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.

      Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.
I&rsquo;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&rsquo;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.

      &hellip;there are a number of points in this interview with Paul Oldfield which are interesting to consider when thinking about &ldquo;doing Agile right&rdquo;. It seems to be compatible with my &ldquo;people over process&rdquo; view - I&rsquo;m not stating that having good people negates the need for any form of process or discipline, I have seen that this is simply not the case. I do however think that agile techniques in particular rely heavily upon the &ldquo;right&rdquo; people / team, for some nebulous definition of &ldquo;right&rdquo;.

I could claim lack of time, but the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &ldquo;Loved &lt;city&gt;, went to talks that made me think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&rdquo;.

      Because I was missing coding, and because my friend and I had an awesome phone app idea at the weekend, I thought I&rsquo;d try my hand at developing an Android application this week.
I want to give a quick overview of my preliminary thoughts on getting started on this endeavour. Background: I&rsquo;ve got more than 10 years Java experience, but any UI for the applications I&rsquo;ve worked on was always a web UI.

I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer.

Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you.

      As a survival trait for living and working in the cites1 of London, I have a set of rituals to avoid hangovers. If you are not a single person living in a city like London, you might not understand how vital this is. Most networking, particularly in the financial services industry, is done in the presence of alcohol.
So preventing the inevitable hangover is quite important to the other part of the job – the actual working bit.

      I know there are arguments against certification, and I definitely think that using certifiction to determine whether to interview or recruit people is downright daft, because frankly learning a bunch of answers isn&rsquo;t all that difficult. But I personally find that completing a certification really helps to round out my knowledge in an area. I guess my thoughts are that a fairly recent certification combined with the work experience to back it up is something that would make your CV more interesting to recruiters.

All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#. Easy, right?
Trisha&rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward. Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:

Since this is my baby, I got to call the shots as to a lot of the framework choices. When it came to looking at implementing validation, I refused to believe I&rsquo;d have to go through the primitive process of looking at all the values on the request and deciding if they pass muster, with some huge if statement.

      When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought generics were the best thing since sliced bread. No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the new for loop, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.Consider the old code:	List list = new ArrayList();	list.add(new Integer(1));	Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0);	for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {	Integer number = (Integer)i.

<p>As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find bugs and security issues early</li>
<li>Improve the readability of our code</li>
<li>Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed</li>

<p>The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.</p>

      Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.
These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.
Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.
I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

      This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.
The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.
ProducerBarriers
The Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

      The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor pattern developed at LMAX.
After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.
ConsumerBarriers and Consumers
I&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

      <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a conference write up.  The short version of &ldquo;why&rdquo; is because I got a bit bored of doing it.  Plus, I 
found I was attending conferences as a speaker &ldquo;on the circuit&rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting
to other attendees to see what they&rsquo;re up to and so forth, didn&rsquo;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out 
whether a conference is worth attending from a content or atmosphere point of view.</p>

        What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

        Improving Speaker Diversity
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&rsquo;t post it now I&rsquo;ll never post it, and it&rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.

      So, following on from my observations of being an outsider at FOSDEM because I&rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.
I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.

GeeCON had its own distinct personality. &nbsp;If you're a Java/JVM person based in Poland, I would highly recommend it - more than 90%of the attendees were Polish (probably the remainder were largely speakers) so this conference is very much for you.

      So, despite promising myself that I would only do one event a month for the rest of this year, looks like I&rsquo;m going to be a bit busier than that.

In case you&rsquo;re wondering what I&rsquo;m up to (or, even better, hoping to see me talk or meet me), here are my confirmed engagements:
15-17 May - GeeCon, Poland
18-20 June - GOTO Amsterdam - whole day tutorial on the new (unfinished) MongoDB Java driver.

Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&rsquo;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&rsquo;t do half as much as some people).

Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve been involved in planning QCon this year. So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. And it&rsquo;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&rsquo;ve helped build.

      As well as talking about, you know, actual work-type-stuff, I was encouraged to give my &ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&rdquo; presentation at Devoxx. This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top. Also, I wasn&rsquo;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&hellip;.

      Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and got me excited about the prospects for 2013.
The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.

      Seemed like a quiet conference this year. Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.
Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&rsquo;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:

It&rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. Last year it was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchess folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&rsquo;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.

I didn&rsquo;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&rsquo;ve never been before and, if I&rsquo;m honest, hadn&rsquo;t heard of it before. So everything was a pleasant surprise.
It&rsquo;s a very geeky conference. I mean that as a compliment, of course. Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&rsquo;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.

But I&rsquo;m really impressed so far.
The program is packed with great topics and speakers, and so many things I want to see that clash with each other.

      I&rsquo;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming. Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) sigh.The problem with these sessions is that you&rsquo;re preaching to the choir. Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause. People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&rsquo;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.

In the spirit of doing something which ticks both the event-speaking and blogging boxes, this is a quick update on the conferences I&rsquo;m confirmed for so far. Put the following dates in your diary - these are my first international solo speaking events:

      At JAX London Mike and I presented &ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.

Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java Community Open Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&rsquo;s near home and I helped to organise it.

My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):
First and foremost, the people. I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. Makes me feel better about the presentations I&rsquo;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchess girls; other Duke Award winners; the Azul guys; guys (well, girls) from O&rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.

This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&rsquo;ll be there with Martin (of the Disruptor fame), and Martijn (that&rsquo;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJC he&rsquo;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committee role.

      On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summit to provide backup for Mike, who was on the &ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&rdquo; panel.
The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &ldquo;users&rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.

      I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.
The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&rsquo;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAX this week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&lt;gross-generalisation&gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.

I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer.

      First, an apology. I will be using the British spelling for &ldquo;centre&rdquo;, because, well, I&rsquo;m British. But it gets really confusing because you have to use the American spelling in the code. And doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Centring&rdquo; just look wrong?
Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical CentringOne of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it. In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn&rsquo;t.

Today&rsquo;s gotcha is table borders.
Yes, yes, I said don&rsquo;t use tables. What I means is, don&rsquo;t use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data. Like, for examples, lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices.
But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&hellip; eccentric&hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.

(Note: unless otherwise stated, the screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac - given an earlier version of this guide I can tell you the behaviour is identical to Firefox on Ubuntu).

      I&rsquo;m a Java Developer. But I&rsquo;m also a Web Developer. Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this. There&rsquo;s some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren&rsquo;t real programmers. Similarly, &ldquo;real&rdquo; developers don&rsquo;t like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &ldquo;front end stuff&rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.

      Living and working in central London, you quickly learn that the fastest way around town is to cycle.
My extensive research into this activity has shown there are a number of different cycling tribes. Of course, I have split them into the two groups that are most appropriate to me: 1) slower than me and 2) faster than me. You can probably tell what sort of a cyclist I am by my attitude to the two groups.

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.
On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&rsquo;s so clever and fast.

      If you see anything about LMAX - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&rsquo;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. However, no-one&rsquo;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. And I realised eventually that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.

  Introduction to the Disruptor  from Trisha Gee 
My slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;s always my original blog posts (the Magic Ring Buffer, Reading from it, Writing to it, Wiring it up), which are now pretty dated, and the Java Magazine article I wrote at the start of the year.

      On Sunday I gave my very first workshop on the Disruptor. The aim was to give people some hands-on coding experience using the syntax. Because time was limited (you can&rsquo;t get people to build an entire application architecture in 2.5 hours) the example is somewhat contrived, and needs a big leap to make it into a proper application context. But the workshop should:

The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.

      Last Tuesday Mike and I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency. This was a preview of the talk we&rsquo;ll be doing at JAX London on the 2nd November.
A video of the session is available, as are the slides. I promise not to say &ldquo;so&rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?

      Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.
My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):
First and foremost, the people. I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. Makes me feel better about the presentations I&rsquo;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchess girls; other Duke Award winners; the Azul guys; guys (well, girls) from O&rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.

      Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.
These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.
Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.
I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.
ProducerBarriers
The Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.

        What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

        Improving Speaker Diversity

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&rsquo;t post it now I&rsquo;ll never post it, and it&rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.

It nicely describes how it feels to be marginalised and not quite &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. But there are some things that I&rsquo;d like to

      So, following on from my observations of being an outsider at FOSDEM because I&rsquo;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.
I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.

What makes me uncomfortable is the international news coverage of the decision of this large manufacturer to hire a woman as their CEO - if she were a man (and/or black/gay/disabled) would the headline read &ldquo;The camera loves her.

Also, I wasn&rsquo;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&hellip;.

      So, &nbsp;before everything gets pushed out of my head, GOTO Copenhagen.
It was my first conference "alone", in that I didn't have friends and colleagues from LMAX or the London Java Community there with me. &nbsp;And certainly at the start of the conference, I wasn't the only one who was standing around, hoping someone would talk to me (in all honesty some of the photos above are a little unfair - the schedule was a very nice, simple phone app so most people spent a lot of time playing with their phones).

      The second in my short series of blogs about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. In it, there&rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &ldquo;classic&rdquo; API, or a blend of both.
The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. Sorry Maven.
If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.

      This year I&rsquo;ve been demonstrating how easy it is to create modern web apps using AngularJS, Java and MongoDB. I also use Groovy during this demo to do the sorts of things Groovy is really good at - writing descriptive tests, and creating scripts.
Due to the time pressures in the demo, I never really get a chance to go into the details of the script I use, so the aim of this long-overdue blog post is to go over this Groovy script in a bit more detail.

      In the last two articles on Spock I&rsquo;ve covered mocking and stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&rsquo;s a killer feature: Data Driven Testing.
All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

      In the last post I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spock as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.
As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.
Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

      <p>Apparently, I&rsquo;m all about Continuous Learning - after I wrote the
<a href="post/stuff_i_learnt_about_intellij">last post about IntelliJ Tips</a>, I carried on through my trawl of the documentation
and, of course, discovered a load more things I didn&rsquo;t know.  And this is all just in the
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Quick+Start">Quick Start</a> section!</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the next batch (although once again I&rsquo;m not sure how many are only applicable to IntelliJ 14).  All shortcuts
are for Windows unless otherwise stated, and Mac users should be able to replace the Ctrl key with Cmd in all these
cases.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Day three of my <a href="/post/new_year_new_adventures">brand new job</a> - woohoo!  One of my first tasks is checking the documentation
of IntelliJ, since I&rsquo;m
already a &ldquo;Power User&rdquo;, to see if there&rsquo;s stuff missing that someone like me might want to see. Firstly, a confession -
I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve actually read the IntelliJ documentation before.  I mean, <em>really</em> read it.  Of course, I&rsquo;ve dipped
into it when I needed to know something, I&rsquo;ve searched for help with specific items, but like many developers, I tend to
use something first rather than read the documentation first.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, today I&rsquo;ve learnt a whole bunch of useful things IntelliJ can do that I hadn&rsquo;t previously known,
and they&rsquo;re the sorts of things you would only stumble over if a) you read the docs (pah!) or b) you watched someone
else using the tool and saw them doing something you didn&rsquo;t know was possible.</p>

      Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &ldquo;the MongoDB people&rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.

      Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&rsquo;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.
It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There&rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.

From the 21st May, I&rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.

supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things
developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well
and good, but if it&rsquo;s not usable those features mean nothing.</em></p>

All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. Sorry Maven.

Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

      A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)
My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers.

      Martin recently announced version 2.0 of the Disruptor - basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&rsquo;s time to mark that officially. His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&rsquo;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again.

      My recent slow-down in posting is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining memory barriers and their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martin and Mike questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.

We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.

      Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.
These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.
Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.
I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

      This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.
The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.
ProducerBarriers
The Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.
ConsumerBarriers and Consumers
I&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.
On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&rsquo;s so clever and fast.

Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.

Background context&nbsp;
Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you.

      When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought generics were the best thing since sliced bread. No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the new for loop, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.Consider the old code:	List list = new ArrayList();	list.add(new Integer(1));	Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0);	for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {	Integer number = (Integer)i.

The wireless access is rubbish.&lt;Gross generalisation&gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. Makes me feel better about the presentations I&rsquo;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&rsquo;ve had a really excellent time, I&rsquo;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchess girls; other Duke Award winners; the Azul guys; guys (well, girls) from O&rsquo;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.

Taylor Street CafeI'm going to be controversial. &nbsp;I think this was my favourite conference of this year. &nbsp;I know that's not trendy, and that Oracle-bashing is still a popular pastime. &nbsp;And I know I've also made a big deal about how much fun it is to meet people who program in different languages. &nbsp;But there is something very special about being surrounded by thousands of people from all around the world who use the same technology as you, some facing the same problems, some solving very different issues.

It&rsquo;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. Last year it was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchess folk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&rsquo;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.

Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&rsquo;d been to.

So, JavaOne, again, my third year there.

      <p><em>Mandatory initial exclamation about how little I have blogged here lately.  Over a year without 
updates, oh dear!  But a) I have been blogging quite a lot for the 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/author/trishagee/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/author/trishagee/">Upsource</a> blogs, and b) I had another 
baby, which kept me quite busy.</em></p>
<p>So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&rsquo;s involved in the 
job, what&rsquo;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&rsquo;s it like 
working remotely etc etc.  Given I also rather generously<sup>1</sup> recently offered to answer 
people&rsquo;s questions about my job, I thought the most scalable way was to write-once-read-many, 
i.e. write it in a single blog post for everyone to read.</p>

      Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &ldquo;the MongoDB people&rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.

      Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.

      For no reason other than LinkedIn communications are starting to irritate me, here&rsquo;s my personal LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.
 I&rsquo;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&rsquo;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.

      Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast, again to talk about all-female events. It&rsquo;s only a short one and there&rsquo;s probably not much in there that I haven&rsquo;t said before, either on here or in person.
From the 21st May, I&rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.

      Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.
I&rsquo;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&rsquo;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.

Far from being discriminated against, however, I find many people ask me why there aren&rsquo;t more women in the industry and what can be done to encourage girls into IT.

They cheat.
This was well described in Freakonomics, and something Mr On Software bangs on about regularly. It&rsquo;s clear that there isn&rsquo;t really a good answer to the problem - actually that&rsquo;s not true. The answer to the problem is to have everyone working in a job they are happy in and proud of, one where they are intrinsically motivated, and give them enough information to allow them to make the correct calls when it comes to prioritising work.

The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&rsquo;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&rsquo;t expect to.

Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.

My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

      Last Tuesday Mike and I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency. This was a preview of the talk we&rsquo;ll be doing at JAX London on the 2nd November.
A video of the session is available, as are the slides. I promise not to say &ldquo;so&rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?

      Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.
My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):
First and foremost, the people. I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

      If you see anything about LMAX - the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&rsquo;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. However, no-one&rsquo;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. And I realised eventually that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.

      Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.
These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.
Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.
I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

      This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.
The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.
ProducerBarriers
The Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.
ConsumerBarriers and Consumers
I&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.

      On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summit to provide backup for Mike, who was on the &ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&rdquo; panel.
The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &ldquo;users&rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.

      I have been struggling with .NET. Actually, I have been fighting pitched battles with it.
All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#. Easy, right?
Trisha&rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward. Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:

      I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.
The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&rsquo;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAX this week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&lt;gross-generalisation&gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.

      At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.

I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.
It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martin and Mike questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.

      We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&rsquo;s even Martin&rsquo;s blog title. It&rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.
We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.

They cheat.
This was well described in Freakonomics, and something Mr On Software bangs on about regularly. It&rsquo;s clear that there isn&rsquo;t really a good answer to the problem - actually that&rsquo;s not true. The answer to the problem is to have everyone working in a job they are happy in and proud of, one where they are intrinsically motivated, and give them enough information to allow them to make the correct calls when it comes to prioritising work.

gave at <a href="http://vimeo.com/72982916">GeeCON</a> and <a href="http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about">DevoxxUK</a>,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.</p>

I'll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I'm desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I'm just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?

But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.

      The second in my short series of blogs about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. In it, there&rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &ldquo;classic&rdquo; API, or a blend of both.
The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. Sorry Maven.
If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.

      Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&rsquo;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.
It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There&rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.

I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

I&rsquo;m learning a lot about these new-fangled NoSQL database thingies. The LMAX architecture was based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path.

        Good overview of the NoSQL hype for Real Developers

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL. Whether you&rsquo;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&rsquo;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&rsquo;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&rsquo;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.
Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      So, I&rsquo;ve finished my first full week in the new job and I&rsquo;ve learnt lots of new stuff. Which is great, because that&rsquo;s usually why you change jobs.
I&rsquo;m learning a lot about these new-fangled NoSQL database thingies. The LMAX architecture was based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented – they agreed to send me to the US.</p>
<p>To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.</p>
<p>In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.</p>
<p>I learnt a number of lessons whilst playing this game.  Some of these points are also valid for teams with remote resources (e.g. people working from home).</p>

      After attending a number of conferences and events, and performing numerous interviews, I&rsquo;m starting to hear the same things again and again. Since Dan North challenged all my assumptions at QCon, I&rsquo;m reluctant to outright ridicule them, but I will put forward my personal opinion.
Note: these are things I have heard from multiple sources, so with any luck I am not breaking the sanctity of the confessional interview.
I&rsquo;ve never pair programmed, but I&rsquo;ve frequently worked with a partner on critical production problems

      Having been back in London for a few days I&rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.
My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):
First and foremost, the people. I don&rsquo;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.

But I&rsquo;m really impressed so far.
The program is packed with great topics and speakers, and so many things I want to see that clash with each other.

aim for weekly and be happy with monthly.</p>
<p>For my first post let&rsquo;s do the obligatory look-back-over-last-year. Not because it&rsquo;s trendy (I&rsquo;m 41 now, I don&rsquo;t care about being trendy any more), but because it&rsquo;s super important for me to understand what I went through and what I achieved last year (every year), otherwise I get caught up in the hamster-wheel of the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing. Progress should be celebrated, not just ignored for the next item on the ever growing, ever pressing TODO list. Also, looking back helps me to plan the next year. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be super-planned, but setting some goals, objectives, ideas for which direction I&rsquo;d prefer to go in helps me decide how to prioritise that ever-growing, ever-pressing TODO list.</p>

<p>As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find bugs and security issues early</li>
<li>Improve the readability of our code</li>
<li>Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.</p>
<p>Here is a quick guide to help you to create an effective code review process.</p>

      Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.

      December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.
I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW! is a unique conference, in that it&rsquo;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.

I&rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&rsquo;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&rsquo;t have a local user group to go to.

      Yesterday I had the nerve-wracking dubious alarming great pleasure of presenting my first official MongoDB-shaped talk. This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.
I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

  Introduction to the Disruptor  from Trisha Gee 
My slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;s always my original blog posts (the Magic Ring Buffer, Reading from it, Writing to it, Wiring it up), which are now pretty dated, and the Java Magazine article I wrote at the start of the year.

      Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new community of developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.
It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>For years I&rsquo;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&rsquo;t want to cover it because I 
didn&rsquo;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&rsquo;t want other 
women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&rsquo;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking
long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&rsquo;s not how everyone works.</p>

        What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>After the acquisition of a company with offices in New York, I pestered my company outrageously until they got fed up and finally relented – they agreed to send me to the US.</p>
<p>To ease the transition, I chose to move onto a project which would allow me to start working in London and continue on the same team after I had moved to New York.</p>
<p>In the extreme over-excitement that followed my relocation, it took me a little while to realise that effectively I was an offshore resource, no different really from any of our Indian test team, and the team needed to manage this appropriately.</p>
<p>I learnt a number of lessons whilst playing this game.  Some of these points are also valid for teams with remote resources (e.g. people working from home).</p>

Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical CentringOne of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it. In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn&rsquo;t.

        CSS for Developers: Cross Browser Table Border Behaviour

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      One of the aims of this series is to highlight some stupid gotchas in support for CSS in the different browsers.
Today&rsquo;s gotcha is table borders.
Yes, yes, I said don&rsquo;t use tables. What I means is, don&rsquo;t use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data. Like, for examples, lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices.
But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&hellip; eccentric&hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.

The screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac. The originals were on Firefox on Ubuntu so I can tell you the behaviour is identical.
Part Three: Column Layout Using CSS (or: still no excuse to use tables)Today&rsquo;s example is a simple one, but worth knowing all the same. The aim is, once again, not to use HTML tables to provide any sort of layout.

      As promised, the Long Awaited Follow-Up to CSS for Developers Part One! Well, long-awaited if you&rsquo;re as afflicted with NADD as I am.
Quick recap - the aim of this series is to provide a quick and easy how-to around the magic that is CSS. It&rsquo;s primarily aimed at developers, although I would hope it&rsquo;s comprehensible to a range of tech-savvy people.
(Note: unless otherwise stated, the screenshots are in Chrome on a Mac - given an earlier version of this guide I can tell you the behaviour is identical to Firefox on Ubuntu).

      I&rsquo;m a Java Developer. But I&rsquo;m also a Web Developer. Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this. There&rsquo;s some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren&rsquo;t real programmers. Similarly, &ldquo;real&rdquo; developers don&rsquo;t like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &ldquo;front end stuff&rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.

I researched, checked styles online, and bought a magazine so I could show my hairdresser exactly what I was after and there would be no confusion. I was determined I would not be spending that ridiculous amount of money on something I was not going to be happy with.

aim for weekly and be happy with monthly.</p>
<p>For my first post let&rsquo;s do the obligatory look-back-over-last-year. Not because it&rsquo;s trendy (I&rsquo;m 41 now, I don&rsquo;t care about being trendy any more), but because it&rsquo;s super important for me to understand what I went through and what I achieved last year (every year), otherwise I get caught up in the hamster-wheel of the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing-and-the-next-thing. Progress should be celebrated, not just ignored for the next item on the ever growing, ever pressing TODO list. Also, looking back helps me to plan the next year. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be super-planned, but setting some goals, objectives, ideas for which direction I&rsquo;d prefer to go in helps me decide how to prioritise that ever-growing, ever-pressing TODO list.</p>

      Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.
I&rsquo;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&rsquo;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.

      I think the statement that struck me the most when I was on the Certified Scrum Master course was: the start of the project is when you know the least about what you&rsquo;re doing.
Which of course is absolutely true.
So why do we come up with extensive requirements, detailed design, and fixed plans at this point of time? We haven&rsquo;t put anything into place yet, we haven&rsquo;t played with the code, the customer hasn&rsquo;t seen anything of what we&rsquo;re promising to deliver.

I'll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I'm desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I'm just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?

      In the last two articles on Spock I&rsquo;ve covered mocking and stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&rsquo;s a killer feature: Data Driven Testing.
All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

      In the last post I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spock as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.
As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.
Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

And I impressed one of my new work collegues. Apparently I am now the Spring Guru.

      Today I would like to document my experiences implementing caching with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) and annotations.&nbsp;

Background context&nbsp;
Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you.

      So if java generics slightly disappointed me lately, what have I found cool?I&rsquo;m currently working on a web application using Spring MVC, which probably doesn&rsquo;t come as a big surprise, it seems to be all the rage these days. Since this is my baby, I got to call the shots as to a lot of the framework choices. When it came to looking at implementing validation, I refused to believe I&rsquo;d have to go through the primitive process of looking at all the values on the request and deciding if they pass muster, with some huge if statement.

To developers technologies are everything
I can&rsquo;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.
Is this true?
It&rsquo;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.

<p>As developers, we all know that code reviews are a good thing in theory. They should help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find bugs and security issues early</li>
<li>Improve the readability of our code</li>
<li>Provide a safety net to ensure all tasks are fully completed</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality is that code reviews can frequently be an uncomfortable experience for everyone involved, leading to reviews that are combative, ineffective, or even worse, simply not happening.</p>
<p>Here is a quick guide to help you to create an effective code review process.</p>

      In the last two articles on Spock I&rsquo;ve covered mocking and stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&rsquo;s a killer feature: Data Driven Testing.
All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

      In the last post I talked about our need for some improved testing tools, our choice of Spock as something to spike, and how mocking looks in Spock.
As that blog got rather long, I saved the next installment for a separate post.
Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Linus Torvalds? I bet for a start it wouldn&rsquo;t mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags. And it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be in baby blue either.

      Web development has changed a lot.
I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer.

      First, an apology. I will be using the British spelling for &ldquo;centre&rdquo;, because, well, I&rsquo;m British. But it gets really confusing because you have to use the American spelling in the code. And doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Centring&rdquo; just look wrong?
Part Five: Horizontal and Vertical CentringOne of the most common things you want to do with blocks of content is to centre it. In particular, you would think that vertically centring content would be straightforward, but it turns out that in HTML/CSS it just isn&rsquo;t.

      One of the aims of this series is to highlight some stupid gotchas in support for CSS in the different browsers.
Today&rsquo;s gotcha is table borders.
Yes, yes, I said don&rsquo;t use tables. What I means is, don&rsquo;t use tables for layout. But you can use tables for, you know, tabular data. Like, for examples, lists of instruments and their bid and ask prices.
But you should know that even when you use strict mode, Internet Explorer has slightly&hellip; eccentric&hellip; rendering behaviour for tables.

      At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.

      I&rsquo;m a Java Developer. But I&rsquo;m also a Web Developer. Web Developers have been so badly maligned over the last decade or so that I always feel wary (and sometimes slightly ashamed) admitting this. There&rsquo;s some sort of assumption that Web Developers (and Front End Developers) aren&rsquo;t real programmers. Similarly, &ldquo;real&rdquo; developers don&rsquo;t like to be tainted by coming into contact with that nasty &ldquo;front end stuff&rdquo; in case someone mistakes them for a designer.

      I&rsquo;m reading Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s User Interface Design for Programmers. A thought that&rsquo;s struck me is about architecture. It&rsquo;s easy to get fooled into thinking building software is a bit like being the architect for a building. I&rsquo;m not even going to go into the differences between engineering practices à la building design and good practice software design. I&rsquo;m going to start from the easy point, the stuff you can see. There&rsquo;s often a pressure from your designers, from your steering committee, even from your CEO, to make your software look &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;.

I'll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I'm desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I'm just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?

It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There&rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.

      Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for GeeCON. Which was excellent! I find it really interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same.
GeeCON had its own distinct personality. &nbsp;If you're a Java/JVM person based in Poland, I would highly recommend it - more than 90%of the attendees were Polish (probably the remainder were largely speakers) so this conference is very much for you.

      Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL. Whether you&rsquo;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&rsquo;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&rsquo;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&rsquo;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.
Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.

Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&rsquo;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&rsquo;t do half as much as some people).

I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

I&rsquo;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&rsquo;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  <em>Obviously</em> all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.</p>
<p>In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I&rsquo;ve had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.
Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.
The Kitchen Is Not For Eating In
Since eating and drinking is unfortunately a fundamental part of being human and staying alive, you will need to provide your staff with a space that pretends to address these needs.

Read if you&rsquo;re a developer and wondering what&rsquo;s missing from your job.
Read if you&rsquo;re a manager and you&rsquo;re looking to recruit the right types of developers. In particular be honest with yourself over whether your organisation is more aligned to &quot;hygiene&quot; or &quot;motivation&quot;. At least one of the poor job decisions I have made is because the role was mis-sold as one and turned out to be the other.

      Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.

      December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.
I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW! is a unique conference, in that it&rsquo;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.
