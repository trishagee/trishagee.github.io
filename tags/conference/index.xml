      <title>JavaZone 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote a conference write up.  The short version of &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; is because I got a bit bored of doing it.  Plus, I found I was attending conferences as a speaker &amp;ldquo;on the circuit&amp;rdquo;, and my experience of hanging out, catching up with my friends, chatting to other attendees to see what they&amp;rsquo;re up to and so forth, didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as useful to share with people who might want to find out whether a conference is worth attending from a content or atmosphere point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel compelled to blog about &lt;a href=&#34;https://2016.javazone.no/&#34;&gt;JavaZone&lt;/a&gt;. I presented there back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/post/javazone_oslo&#34;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, but every year since then haven&amp;rsquo;t made it for one reason or another (the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s near my birthday in no way impacts my schedulingâ€¦).  I made the effort this year, and I&amp;rsquo;m so pleased.  Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been to many more conferences, of various sizes, various themes, all around the world, and I can definitely state that JavaZone is up there as one of the best conferences around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Android Xtended</title>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align:center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/xt15-calm.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300px&#34; alt=&#34;The calm before the storm&#34; title=&#34;The calm before the storm&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them.  I could claim lack of time, but the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading that, but I get bored of writing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/xt15-fun.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34; title=&#34;Conferences are fun&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I&amp;rsquo;m bored of conferences. On the contrary - since I work from home, travelling to new places and meeting Real Human Beings keeps me sane. Plus conferences are fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;float:right; padding: 10px&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/static/images/androidxtended/xt15-setup.jpg&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34; alt=&#34;The 
setup&#34; title=&#34;The setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I went to a conference on Saturday that makes me feel compelled to write something, and not just because it was organised by my two fellow &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Sevilla JUG&lt;/a&gt; organisers. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/israkaos&#34;&gt;@IsraKaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rgdav&#34;&gt;@RGDav&lt;/a&gt; are both doing more Android day-to-day than server-side Java, so this is an area they&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about. Not content with organising Android events every other month, they decided they had so many interesting speakers they wanted to have speaking here in Sevilla that they wanted to run a whole day, single track conference, on behalf of &lt;a href=&#34;https://plus.google.com/communities/114997118727600981533&#34;&gt;GDG Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.androidxtended.com/&#34;&gt;Android Xtended&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m at JavaOne again, and after only one day I&amp;rsquo;ve already learnt stuff.  And, of course, had a great time catching up with interesting people.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the first day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving,
which happens to be the same one I&amp;rsquo;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&amp;rsquo;m evolving it as I go along).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
