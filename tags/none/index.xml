      <description>Isn&#39;t a shame that actual day-to-day work always seems to get in the way of progress? How you&#39;re always too busy fire-fighting to actually perform the critical thing that might actually improve affairs.
All this is basically a setup for a roundabout excuse for why this blog has been neglected so shortly after it was begun. I was a bit too busy doing the day job.
Still, people like Joel and Scott manage regular pronouncements and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re much busier than I!</description>
