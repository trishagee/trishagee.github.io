      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&#39;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&#39;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Etiquette</title>

      <description>For no reason other than LinkedIn communications are starting to irritate me, here&#39;s my personal LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.
 I&#39;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&#39;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting discussion last night at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; developer sessions, and
it&#39;s a topic that comes up again and again:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re applying for a job at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;, your CV (or résumé, for our American readers) usually comes through me and I decide whether 
to call you for a technical phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to let you into a secret.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We are hiring!
If you think we&#39;re doing something interesting, or if you think you can help us do our thing even better, come join us. Your boss will be the dude who wrote Continuous Delivery, you&#39;ll get a chance to experience what Danny calls meta-Agile (or Agile Agile), and you&#39;ll really start to care about Domain-Driven Design.
Ideally we&#39;re after Java people, but at the heart of it we want people who are dead passionate about development.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve learnt a lot professionally and personally during my time here in New York, but the time has come to go back &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo;.I&#39;ll be relocating to London in September. I guess it won&#39;t hurt to mention on here that I&#39;ll be looking for an exciting new job when I get back there. Check out my LinkedIn profile if you are in the market for a Java tech team lead.</description>
