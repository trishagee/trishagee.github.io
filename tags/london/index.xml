      <description>&lt;p&gt;Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to &lt;a href=&#34;http://010dev.nl/post/social-tech-event-the-disruptor-and-the-perfect-programmer&#34;&gt;present to a brand new community&lt;/a&gt; of developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m late with my write-up of &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;, and what&amp;rsquo;s worse, it will be partial - &amp;ldquo;sadly&amp;rdquo; I was in Lanzarote on a training week with the running club from the Thursday (8th) so I missed most of it. A sacrifice I had to make for 7 days in the sunshine&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>And now, a post for my long-neglected, less technical readers.
I took a week off in July to try and avoid that Oh My God I Missed Summer Again feeling. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get that in the UK even if you&amp;rsquo;re not stuck in an office the entire time.
Really this is just an excuse to post some photos on the blog.
Monday
Hopped on the bike and explored from Kensington to Westminster.</description>
