      <description>&lt;p&gt;New versions of Java are coming out every 6 months now. What has changed, should we upgrade, and if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>News from IntelliJ IDEA Community</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/fosdem_2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video and resources for the Update on IntelliJ IDEA talk from FOSDEM 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With releases of Java coming thick and fast every six months, it&amp;rsquo;s a full time job staying on top of the features. If
your IDE can help you here, it&amp;rsquo;s one less thing to worry about. IntelliJ IDEA Community has three releases every
year, each one improves the support for modern versions of Java, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing on offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join this session to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in IntelliJ IDEA Community (the free one!). This is not limited to just
supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things
developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well
and good, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not usable those features mean nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting staying up to date with the evolution of Java and the myriad other JVM languages.  Is it worth it? What

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think living in a beautiful city in a fantastic climate has its advantages.  Not just the obvious ones, but we find people unusually keen to come and visit us on the pretence of presenting at the Sevilla Java User Group (and please, DO come and present at our JUG, we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; visitors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we were really lucky, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gsaab&#34;&gt;Georges Saab&lt;/a&gt; and Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro giving us an update on where Java is now and where it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant, mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example, where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been missing an introduction to using MongoDB from Java for a little while now - there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of information in &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;, but we were lacking a step-by-step guide to getting started as a Java developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to rectify this with a couple of blog posts for the MongoDB official blog: the first, an introduction to using MongoDB from Java, including a non-comprehensive list of some of the libraries you can use; the second, an introductory guide to simple CRUD operations using the Java driver:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Web development has changed a lot.
I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and Iâve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I donât mean reusable in the way we used to âreuseâ stuff by nicking it off other peopleâs websites when we saw something cool.
I used to be a web developer.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two articles on Spock I&amp;rsquo;ve covered &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2013/07/09/spock_is_awesome_seriously_simplified_mocking/&#34;&gt;mocking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2013/07/10/spock_passes_the_next_test__painless_stubbing/&#34;&gt;stubbing&lt;/a&gt;.  And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that.  But for a database driver, there&amp;rsquo;s a killer feature: &lt;a href=&#34;http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.3/data_driven_testing.html&#34;&gt;Data Driven Testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I&amp;rsquo;ve written a blog post for Somewhere Else. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&amp;rsquo;m just linking you to them instead.
Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver.  Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How are you using MongoDB with Java?</title>

      <description>So, like one of my presentations, I have a question for you. Actually, I have more than one question for you. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:
Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t you hate it when you ask a perfectly good question, and someone comes back with the answer &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating to think that in a world of ones and zeros, people can&amp;rsquo;t give absolute answers and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>On Monday, Stephen Chin from Oracle visited me at the 10gen offices as part of his NightHacking tour. In the video we talk about my sessions at JavaOne and the Agile presentation I&amp;rsquo;m giving at Devoxx, and I do some very basic hacking using the MongoDB Java driver, attempting to showcase gradle at the same time. It was a fun experience, even if it&amp;rsquo;s scary being live-streamed and recorded!</description>

      <description>This month&amp;rsquo;s Java Magazine features an article by yours truly, which is yet another intro to the Disruptor. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a summary of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve written in this blog, updated for version 2.7 - so the names of the classes should be up to date and the responsibilities follow the simplified pattern we use now. If you were looking for an more recent version of my introduction blog posts, this article gives a reasonable overview.</description>

      <title>JAX London - I learn stuff and meet people</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__i_learn_stuff_and_meet_people/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt; along with a number of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; regulars (&lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://jr0cket.com/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/members/5737653/&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://devangelist.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://zoah.co.uk/jax-london&#34;&gt;Zoe&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My purpose for attending was largely to present the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/10/21/mike_and_i_debut_our_new_disruptor_presentation/&#34;&gt;Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; talk that &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday Mike and I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency. This was a preview of the talk we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing at JAX London on the 2nd November.
A video of the session is available, as are the slides. I promise not to say &amp;ldquo;so&amp;rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it&amp;rsquo;s time to record some of my observations so far:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We are hiring!
If you think we&amp;rsquo;re doing something interesting, or if you think you can help us do our thing even better, come join us. Your boss will be the dude who wrote Continuous Delivery, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to experience what Danny calls meta-Agile (or Agile Agile), and you&amp;rsquo;ll really start to care about Domain-Driven Design.
Ideally we&amp;rsquo;re after Java people, but at the heart of it we want people who are dead passionate about development.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/08/disruptor-20-released.html&#34;&gt;announced version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt; - basically there have been so many changes since we first open-sourced it that it&amp;rsquo;s time to mark that officially.  His post goes over all the changes, the aim of this article is to attempt to translate my previous blog posts into new-world-speak, since it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a long time to re-write each of them all over again.  Now I see the disadvantage of hand-drawing everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Disruptor: Demystifying Memory Barriers</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_demystifying_memory_barriers/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_demystifying_memory_barriers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent slow-down in posting is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier&#34;&gt;memory barriers&lt;/a&gt; and their applicability in &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject.  I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rather than make an idiot of myself trying to explain something I don&amp;rsquo;t really get, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and cover, at an abstract / massive-simplification level, what I do understand in the area.  Martin has written a post &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/memory-barriersfences.html&#34;&gt;going into memory barriers&lt;/a&gt; in some detail, so hopefully I can get away with skimming the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Disruptor: Why it&#39;s so fast (part two) - Magic cache line padding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s even &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martin&amp;rsquo;s blog title&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptorsource/browse/trunk/code/src/main/com/lmax/disruptor/RingBuffer.java&#34;&gt;RingBuffer&lt;/a&gt;, and I referred to it in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/07/16/dissecting_the_disruptor_why_its_so_fast_part_one__locks_are_bad/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;.  Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&amp;rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Martin Fowler has written a &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1736243820&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;really good article&lt;span id=&#34;goog_1736243821&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; describing not only &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, but also how it fits into the architecture at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;.  This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &amp;ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working up to answering that.  I&amp;rsquo;m currently on question number two: &amp;ldquo;Why is it so fast?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Disruptor: Wiring up the dependencies</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_wiring_up_the_dependencies/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_wiring_up_the_dependencies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;rsquo;ve covered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/06/22/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/&#34;&gt;ring buffer&lt;/a&gt; itself, &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/06/28/dissecting_the_disruptor_how_do_i_read_from_the_ring_buffer/&#34;&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; from it and &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/07/04/dissecting_the_disruptor_writing_to_the_ring_buffer/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/a&gt; done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer. Like a lot of applications, we have a pipeline of things that need to happen before we can actually get on with the business logic - for example, we need to make sure the messages have been journalled to disk before we can do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;Disruptor paper&lt;/a&gt; and the performance tests cover some basic configurations that you might want. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go over the most interesting one, mostly because I needed the practice with the graphics tablet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_writing_to_the_ring_buffer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. Brace yourselves, it&amp;rsquo;s quite long. But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next in the series of understanding &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;the Disruptor pattern&lt;/a&gt; developed at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmaxtrader.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/06/22/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&amp;rsquo;re using the Disruptor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Disruptor: What&#39;s so special about a ring buffer?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/dissecting_the_disruptor_whats_so_special_about_a_ring_buffer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we open sourced the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor&#34;&gt;LMAX Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;, the key to what makes our exchange so fast.  Why did we open source it?  Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&amp;hellip; a bit wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world.  Plus it makes us look dead clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the site you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;download a technical article&lt;/a&gt; explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&amp;rsquo;s so clever and fast.  I even get a writing credit on it, which is gratifying when all I really did is insert commas and re-phrase sentences I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I find the whole thing a bit much to digest all at once, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain it in smaller pieces, as suits my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html&#34;&gt;NADD&lt;/a&gt; audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up - the ring buffer.  Initially I was under the impression the Disruptor was just the ring buffer.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realise that while this data structure is at the heart of the pattern, the clever bit about the Disruptor is controlling access to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been struggling with .NET. Actually, I have been fighting pitched battles with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#. Easy, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trishas-guide-to-converting-java-to-c&#34;&gt;Trisha&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward. Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As an associate member of the London Java Community (LJC), I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee. The results show that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &amp;ldquo;landslide&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved.</description>

      <description>At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.</description>
