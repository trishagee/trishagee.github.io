<p><em>With releases of Java coming thick and fast every six months, it&rsquo;s a full time job staying on top of the features. If
your IDE can help you here, it&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about. IntelliJ IDEA Community has three releases every
year, each one improves the support for modern versions of Java, but that&rsquo;s not the only thing on offer.</em></p>
<p><em>Join this session to see what&rsquo;s new in IntelliJ IDEA Community (the free one!). This is not limited to just
supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things
developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well
and good, but if it&rsquo;s not usable those features mean nothing.</em></p>

      Web development has changed a lot.
I was aware that there have been many changes in the last few years, and I’ve seen maturity come to web platforms in the form of standardisation and common reusable libraries and frameworks - and I don’t mean reusable in the way we used to “reuse” stuff by nicking it off other people’s websites when we saw something cool.I used to be a web developer.

      In the last two articles on Spock I&rsquo;ve covered mocking and stubbing. And I was pretty sold on Spock just based on that. But for a database driver, there&rsquo;s a killer feature: Data Driven Testing.
All developers have a tendency to think of and test the happy path. Not least of all because that&rsquo;s usually the path in the User Story - &ldquo;As a customer I want to withdraw money and have the correct amount in my hand&rdquo;.

The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. Sorry Maven.
If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.

Today I want to look at stubbing.
Stubbing
Mocking is great for checking outputs - in the example in the last post, we&rsquo;re checking that the process of encoding an array calls the right things on the way out, if you like - that the right stuff gets poked onto the bsonWriter.

      We&rsquo;re constantly fighting a battle when developing the new MongoDB Java driver between using tools that will do heavy lifting for us and minimising the dependencies a user has to download in order to use our driver. Ideally, we want the number of dependencies to be zero.
This is not going to be the case when it comes to testing, however. At the very least, we&rsquo;re going to use JUnit or TestNG (we used testng in the previous version, we&rsquo;ve switched to JUnit for 3.

It&rsquo;s an answer I&rsquo;ve given so many times, especially when someone asks about performance. Well, I&rsquo;ve had my comeuppance. The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for MongoDB has been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;:

      Martin Fowler has written a really good article describing not only the Disruptor, but also how it fits into the architecture at LMAX. This gives some of the context that has been missing so far, but the most frequently asked question is still &ldquo;What is the Disruptor?&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m working up to answering that. I&rsquo;m currently on question number two: &ldquo;Why is it so fast?&rdquo;.
These questions do go hand in hand, however, because I can&rsquo;t talk about why it&rsquo;s fast without saying what it does, and I can&rsquo;t talk about what it is without saying why it is that way.

      So now I&rsquo;ve covered the ring buffer itself, reading from it and writing to it.
Logically the next thing to do is to wire everything up together.
I talked about multiple producers - they have the producer barrier to keep them in order and under control. I&rsquo;ve talked about consumers in a simple situation. Multiple consumers can get a little more involved. We&rsquo;ve done some clever stuff to allow the consumers to be dependent on each other and the ring buffer.

      This is the missing piece in the end-to-end view of the Disruptor. &nbsp;Brace yourselves, it's quite long. &nbsp;But I decided to keep it in a single blog so you could have the context in one place.
The important areas are: not wrapping the ring; informing the consumers; batching for producers; and how multiple producers work.
ProducerBarriers
The Disruptor code has interfaces and helper classes for the Consumers, but there's no interface for your producer, the thing that writes to the ring buffer.

      The next in the series of understanding the Disruptor pattern developed at LMAX.
After the last post we all understand ring buffers and how awesome they are. Unfortunately for you, I have not said anything about how to actually populate them or read from them when you&rsquo;re using the Disruptor.
ConsumerBarriers and Consumers
I&rsquo;m going to approach this slightly backwards, because it&rsquo;s probably easier to understand in the long run. Assuming that some magic has populated it: how do you read something from the ring buffer?

      Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&hellip; a bit wrong. We&rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and it would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.
On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&rsquo;s so clever and fast.

      I have been struggling with .NET. Actually, I have been fighting pitched battles with it.
All I want to do is take our existing Java client example code and write an equivalent in C#. Easy, right?
Trisha&rsquo;s Guide to Converting Java to C#Turns out writing the actual C# is relatively straightforward. Putting to one side the question of writing optimal code (these are very basic samples after all), to get the examples to compile and run was a simple process:

      At LMAX we adopted Google Web Toolkit pretty early on. One of the motivations for using it was so we only had to worry about recruiting Java guys, and then we could all work on every part of the application including the web UI. Sure, you can learn a bunch of different skills if you want to, but it reduced context-switching and kept the skill set we were hiring for to a nice short list.
