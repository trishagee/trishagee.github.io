      <title>Being a Developer Advocate at JetBrains</title>

      <description>Mandatory initial exclamation about how little I have blogged here lately. Over a year without updates, oh dear! But a) I have been blogging quite a lot for the IntelliJ IDEA and Upsource blogs, and b) I had another baby, which kept me quite busy.
So on that topic (more or less) I get a lot of questions about my job: what&amp;rsquo;s involved in the job, what&amp;rsquo;s it like working for JetBrains, what does a Developer Advocate do, what&amp;rsquo;s it like working remotely etc etc.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you keep your skills up to date in this fast-moving and turbulant 
industry?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Path To Evangelism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I get asked a lot about how I got into technical advocacy / 
evangelism&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 
so it seems like the most cost-effective way to answer this question is to 
write a post about it. Warning: it&amp;rsquo;s a long one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New Year, New Adventures</title>

      <description>Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems 
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

      <description>I was flattered a couple of weeks ago to be interviewed by Google as part of their women techmaker&amp;rsquo;s series, as it moves over to Europe. In this video I talk about going to Mars, education, planning your career, being a developer, and the impact of technology on our lives. So, not much&amp;hellip;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting discussion last night at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;LJC&lt;/a&gt; developer sessions, and
it&amp;rsquo;s a topic that comes up again and again:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re applying for a job at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt;, your CV (or résumé, for our American readers) usually comes through me and I decide whether 
to call you for a technical phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you into a secret.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
