      <description>Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam toÂ present to a brand new communityof developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&#39;d never given a presentation in a pub.</description>
