      <description>Last night was the inaugural meeting of the Sevilla MongoDN User Group. &amp;nbsp;An event organised with just over 48 hours notice, in a city where I don&amp;rsquo;t speak the language and where even my best-connected contacts aren&amp;rsquo;t sure they&amp;rsquo;re fully plugged in to the tech scene.
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I&amp;rsquo;m desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I&amp;rsquo;m just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?</description>

      <description>Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to&amp;nbsp;present to a brand new community of developers. &amp;nbsp;I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.
It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&amp;rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.</description>
