      <description>For no reason other than LinkedIn communications are starting to irritate me, here&amp;rsquo;s my personal LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.
 I&amp;rsquo;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.</description>

      <description>InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. &amp;nbsp;Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. &amp;nbsp;We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&amp;rsquo;s going through the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.</description>
