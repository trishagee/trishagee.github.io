      <description>For no reason other than LinkedIncommunications are starting to irritate me, here&#39;s my personal LinkedIn Etiquette guide. Feel free to disagree with it all.
 I&#39;m not going to accept invitations from recruiters. Not just because I&#39;m not looking for a job (who knows what the future holds?), but because I believe it shows a lack of respect to my network to bring recruiters one step closer to being able to contact them all.</description>

      <description>InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&#39;s going through the interviewer&#39;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.</description>
