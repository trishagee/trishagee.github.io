      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, before everything gets pushed out of my head, GOTO Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first conference &amp;ldquo;alone&amp;rdquo;, in that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have friends and colleagues from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lmax.com/&#34;&gt;LMAX&lt;/a&gt; or the London Java Community there with me. And certainly at the start of the conference, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one who was standing around, hoping someone would talk to me (in all honesty some of the photos above are a little unfair - the schedule was a very nice, simple phone app so most people spent a lot of time playing with their phones).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
