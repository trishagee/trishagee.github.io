      <description>So, &amp;nbsp;before everything gets pushed out of my head, GOTO Copenhagen.
It was my first conference &#34;alone&#34;, in that I didn&#39;t have friends and colleagues from LMAX or the London Java Community there with me. &amp;nbsp;And certainly at the start of the conference, I wasn&#39;t the only one who was standing around, hoping someone would talk to me (in all honesty some of the photos above are a little unfair - the schedule was a very nice, simple phone app so most people spent a lot of time playing with their phones).</description>
