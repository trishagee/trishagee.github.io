      <description>Just over two years ago, I embarked upon a journey as a developer / evangelist for a company who was then called 10gen (who got fed up of saying &amp;ldquo;the MongoDB people&amp;rdquo;, and transformed into MongoDB Inc). My goals for this role were: to learn what it was like working for a company that produced a technology product; to discover what impact working in an open source fashion has; and to level up my advocacy skills.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant,
mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example,
where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.

      <description>This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been demonstrating how easy it is to create modern web apps using AngularJS, Java and MongoDB. I also use Groovy during this demo to do the sorts of things Groovy is really good at - writing descriptive tests, and creating scripts.
Due to the time pressures in the demo, I never really get a chance to go into the details of the script I use, so the aim of this long-overdue blog post is to go over this Groovy script in a bit more detail.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with MongoDB and Java</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/getting_started_with_mongodb_and_java/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been missing an introduction to using MongoDB from Java for a little while now - there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of information in &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/&#34;&gt;the
documentation&lt;/a&gt;, but we were lacking a step-by-step guide to getting started as a Java
developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sought to rectify this with a couple of blog posts for the MongoDB official blog: the first, an introduction to using MongoDB from
Java, including a non-comprehensive list of some of the libraries you can use; the second, an introductory guide to simple CRUD
operations using the Java driver:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.

I think he brings out the best in me.

      <description>Last night the Sevilla MUG had our March Madness event. This was our largest event yet, with 36 people signed up. Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month, that&amp;rsquo;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main attraction - Javier gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at SocialBro after using MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.</description>

      <description>Last night was the inaugural meeting of the Sevilla MongoDN User Group. &amp;nbsp;An event organised with just over 48 hours notice, in a city where I don&amp;rsquo;t speak the language and where even my best-connected contacts aren&amp;rsquo;t sure they&amp;rsquo;re fully plugged in to the tech scene.
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, I had some reservations:
a lightning talk? Will people come all that way for beer and 15 minutes of presentation?in English? Whilst I&amp;rsquo;m desperately learning Spanish to get closer to presenting in Spanish, at this point I&amp;rsquo;m just not ready and have to hope people want to listen to me ramble in a foreign languagea MUG?</description>

      <description>In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&amp;hellip;.
But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.</description>

      <description>The second in my short series of blogs about the new Java driver is now available for your perusal. &amp;nbsp;In it, there&amp;rsquo;s some guidance on how to get started using the new driver, whether you want to use the new (unfinished) API, the existing &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; API, or a blend of both.
The post also shows that Gradle is prettier than Maven. &amp;nbsp;Sorry Maven.
If you are going to play with the new driver, please read all the caveats carefully.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.
It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. &amp;nbsp;There&amp;rsquo;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&amp;rsquo;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.</description>

      <description>I feel slightly like a traitor to my own blog, as I&amp;rsquo;ve written a blog post for Somewhere Else. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the design goals for the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver in the official MongoDB blog (seems sensible, right?). &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about cross-posting the entire contents, so I&amp;rsquo;m just linking you to them instead.
Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been to my Backwards Compatibility presentation this year might notice something familiar about the content.</description>

      <description>So, like one of my presentations, I have a question for you. &amp;nbsp;Actually, I have more than one question for you. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to bother with survey monkey or whatever, I want to share the answers so please, answers in the comments:
Are you using the Java driver for MongoDB in your application?Are you using the Java driver directly, or are you using a third party library like Morphia, Spring Data, the Scala driver, your own abstraction layer, etc?</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL. &amp;nbsp;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&amp;rsquo;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&amp;rsquo;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.
Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. &amp;nbsp;I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you hate it when you ask a perfectly good question, and someone comes back with the answer &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;?
It&amp;rsquo;s so frustrating to think that in a world of ones and zeros, people can&amp;rsquo;t give absolute answers and you can&amp;rsquo;t rely on &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s an answer I&amp;rsquo;ve given so many times, especially when someone asks about performance. &amp;nbsp;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my&amp;nbsp;comeuppance. &amp;nbsp;The entire exercise of designing the new Java driver for MongoDB has been nothing but a series of questions where the answer is &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <description>Hot on the heels of my very first MongoDB webinar,&amp;nbsp;I was&amp;hellip; encouraged&amp;hellip; to do another. &amp;nbsp;Here at 10gen we&amp;rsquo;ve been running a series of webinars around using MongoDB in the financial services domain. &amp;nbsp;Yesterday was the last in the series, and was presented in association with C24&amp;nbsp;- John Davies, their CTO, did most of the talking, and demonstrated their product for automatically turning financial messages from one format into another.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the nerve-wracking dubious alarming&amp;nbsp;great pleasure of presenting my first official MongoDB-shaped talk. &amp;nbsp;This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.
I naÃ¯vely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t really. &amp;nbsp;For a start, you can&amp;rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.</description>

      <description>Devoxx topped off a crazy two months of conferences. I&#39;ve heard people talk about the conference season in the past, and been slightly (OK, very) jealous of all that jet-setting. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll admit, however, to a slight feeling of relief that my focus until Christmas is pretty much going to be coding. &amp;nbsp;I hope.

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve finished my first full week in the new job and I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt lots of new stuff. Which is great, because that&amp;rsquo;s usually why you change jobs.
I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot about these new-fangled NoSQL database thingies. The LMAX architecture was based on keeping everything in memory and reducing the waits for IO - messages were journalled to disk, and reads and writes to the MySQL database were off the critical path.</description>
