      <description>So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blogthan a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&#39;d been to.So, JavaOne, again, my third year there. I&#39;ll always have a fondness for it - because of Martin Thompson, it was the first conference I presented at.</description>
