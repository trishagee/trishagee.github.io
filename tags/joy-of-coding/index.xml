&lt;p&gt;I’m on a plane (there’s a surprise) on my way back from &lt;a href=&#34;http://joyofcoding.org/&#34;&gt;The Joy of Coding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the title that attracted me to this conference, and it was a great little one day event with awesome people like Dan North, Erik Meijer and Dick Wall presenting. What I liked about the themes is they were broadly technology agnostic, pulling back to a level which made me remember why I’m a developer. It inspired me to do more research and more thinking, and less panicking and trying to write code. That might seem odd, as someone who goes to as many conferences as I do should get loads more research and thinking time than most developers living under the whip, but I seem to spend so much time bouncing from thing to thing I don’t get space to just sit and think, or to read things in any depth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
