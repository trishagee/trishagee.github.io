      Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle's Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.
It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There's a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it's not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I'd like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.

      InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what's going through the interviewer's mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.

GeeCON had its own distinct personality. &nbsp;If you're a Java/JVM person based in Poland, I would highly recommend it - more than 90%of the attendees were Polish (probably the remainder were largely speakers) so this conference is very much for you.

      Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL.

Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.

Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome.

      On Monday, Stephen Chin from Oracle visited me at the 10gen offices as part of his NightHacking tour. &nbsp;In the video we talk about my sessions at JavaOne and the Agile presentation I'm giving at Devoxx, and I do some very basic hacking using the MongoDB Java driver, attempting to showcase gradle at the same time. It was a fun experience, even if it's scary being live-streamed and recorded!

      I was interviewed at GOTO Copenhagen, about Java, the Disruptor, the Graduate Developer Community &amp; London Java Community, and a whole host of other things. So to make up for the lack of blogging this month, here it is:

      The &ldquo;User's Guide to the Disruptor&rdquo; presentation I gave at QCon London is now available on the InfoQ site. This is the same presentation as the one I gave at Skillsmatter in March, but the questions are different. Plus since I'm winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.

      I was flattered to be interviewed for InfoQ at QCon London. It was a fun interview actually, and didn't feel anything like the half an hour it actually took. In it, I get to talk about Agile at LMAX, the Disruptor (of course) and diversity in IT (again).

      At JAX London Mike and I presented &ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner's Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.

      It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late. But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.
But before I move on, it's probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.
1) Martin Thompson and I are interviewed about the Disruptor winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):

      Remember a while back I talked about my first public appearance?
Well, I chased down the video, because I'm masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. &nbsp;Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman's body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. &nbsp;It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can't see me.
