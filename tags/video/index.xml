      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bryant and I did a keynote at Devoxx UK about how individuals can add something to a team to make the team 
more productive, and overall more awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interviewed by InfoQ</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was at QCon New York (probably my business conference this year!) I was 
interviewed by Ralph Winzinger for InfoQ. It felt like a short interview at the time, 
but we covered a lot of ground - Java 8, Java vs other JVM languages, the effectiveness
of the JCP, and the future of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video and the transcript are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/interviews/trisha-gee-java-eco-system&#34;&gt;available on InfoQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving, 
which happens to be the same one I&#39;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&#39;m evolving it as I go along).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday &lt;a href=&#34;http://steveonjava.com/&#34;&gt;Mr Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; came to Sevilla on his crazy European tour to show us Lego and Robots.  This was our largest turnout yet 
for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/SVQJUG/&#34;&gt;Java User Group&lt;/a&gt; event in Sevilla, which surprised me as it was on a weekend, 
and the weekend before the spectacle that is &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_Seville&#34;&gt;Semana 
Santa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtu.be/I5rnDZGNJW8&#34;&gt;in Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility? (YOW 2013)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&#39;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&#39;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

I think he brings out the best in me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for vJUG, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&#39;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&#39;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&#39;t normally go to conferences or don&#39;t have a local user group to go to.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Stephen Chin, one of Oracle&#39;s Java Evangelists and the JavaOne content chair, interviewed me via a live stream about JavaOne, the new MongoDB Java driver, and my plans to Change The World.It was a fun interview to do, and I really like the format of being interviewed over Skype and streaming my desktop. There&#39;s a slight (OK, 25 seconds, not really low latency) lag between the screen and the speaking which means it&#39;s not a great platform for doing live demos, but I think I&#39;d like to do more code demos in this way, if I can find a suitable platform.</description>

      <title>Life on both sides of the interview table</title>

      <description>InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&#39;s going through the interviewer&#39;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.</description>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_summary_of_geecon_krakow/</guid>
      <description>Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for GeeCON. Which was excellent! I find it really interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same.
From a speaker&#39;s point of view, there were some cultural things which took a bit of getting used to. One of the good things was that the audience was very keen on asking questions, they were much more interactive than a typical London audience (for example).</description>

      <title>Good overview of the NoSQL hype for Real Developers</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/good_overview_of_the_nosql_hype_for_real_developers/</guid>
      <description>Last Tuesday I went to a London Java Community talk which promised to debunk the hype around NoSQL. Whether you&#39;re already bought into a NoSQL technology, or you&#39;re just wondering what all the noise is about, it&#39;s worth an hour out of your day to see Akmal Chaudhri&#39;s comprehensive summary of the technologies out there.Skillsmatter recorded the whole thing, as usual, so you can watch the presentation for yourself. I promise neither I nor anyone else from 10gen paid him to mention MongoDB so much.</description>

      <description>Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.
Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&#39;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&#39;t do half as much as some people).</description>

      <description>I was flattered a couple of weeks ago to be interviewed by Google as part of their women techmaker&#39;s series, as it moves over to Europe. In this video I talk about going to Mars, education, planning your career, being a developer, and the impact of technology on our lives. So, not much&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As well as talking about, you know, actual work-type-stuff, I was encouraged to give my &amp;ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&amp;rdquo; presentation at Devoxx. This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top. Also, I wasn&#39;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>On the same day Stephen Chin came to see meat the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.</description>

This is the same presentation as the one I gave at Skillsmatter in March, but the questions are different. Plus since I&#39;m winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.</description>

      <description>At JAX London Mike and I presented &amp;ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&amp;rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.</description>

      <description>It must be time for me to move on from talking about Java One, it has dominated my blog of late. But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.But before I move on, it&#39;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.1) Martin Thompsonand I are interviewed about the Disruptor winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):2) I&#39;m interviewed by Duchessabout life, the universe and everything (well, the London Java Community, the JCP, the LMAX Disruptor and Duke Award, and women programmers).</description>
