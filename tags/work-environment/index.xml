      <description>Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.
Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.
The Kitchen Is Not For Eating In

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How important to you is your working environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of desk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music / background sound (or lack of it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
