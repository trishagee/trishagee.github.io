      <description>Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.
Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.

      <description>How important to you is your working environment? &amp;nbsp;- Type of desk &amp;nbsp;- What&amp;rsquo;s on it &amp;nbsp;- Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s) &amp;nbsp;- Music / background sound (or lack of it) &amp;nbsp;- Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office &amp;nbsp;- etc&amp;hellip; These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment: &amp;nbsp;- Eclipse / IntelliJ Idea / Visual Studio (is it still called this?) / other dev enviornment - setup, preferences, window positions &amp;nbsp;- OS &amp;nbsp;- Desktop icons - do you care what / how many / positioning &amp;nbsp;- Which software is always open when you&amp;rsquo;re working, and does it matter what order you open them in (so they&amp;rsquo;re in the correct place on your task bar) (additional: does not having enough RAM&amp;nbsp;cripple you because you have to constantly shut and re-open software?</description>
