      <description>Due to a combination of my restlessness, my consulting experience, and employers that insist on moving offices frequently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the dubious honour of working in a variety of environments.
Today I will teach you, the employer, how to show your staff just how much you hate them.

      <description>How important to you is your working environment? - Type of desk - What&amp;rsquo;s on it - Position / type of mouse, keyboard, monitor(s) - Music / background sound (or lack of it) - Open plan vs team room vs cube vs personal office - etc&amp;hellip; These physical items could be extended to include your virtual environment: - Eclipse / IntelliJ Idea / Visual Studio (is it still called this?) / other dev enviornment - setup, preferences, window positions - OS - Desktop icons - do you care what / how many / positioning - Which software is always open when you&amp;rsquo;re working, and does it matter what order you open them in (so they&amp;rsquo;re in the correct place on your task bar) (additional: does not having enough RAMÂ cripple you because you have to constantly shut and re-open software?</description>
