      <title>What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_women_speakers/</guid>
      <description>Now I&#39;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to present at a lot of conferences. Obviously all these conferences are mostly interested in my terribly educational talks, but it&#39;s also because I&#39;m a technical woman and there aren&#39;t very many technical women speaking at conferences.
In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees.</description>

another post to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving Speaker Diversity</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/more_female_speakers/</guid>
      <description>Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&#39;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&#39;t post it now I&#39;ll never post it, and it&#39;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Wow. My 4th QCon London. That’s not bad. And every time, it’s a different experience (if you must, see my blogs for 2013, 2012, and even 2007 (part 1&amp;amp; part 2- how cute was I? &amp;ldquo;agile seems like a jolly good idea; automated testing appears to be important&amp;rdquo;)).I can’t even tell you what I did on the first day, I was mostly panicking about my presentation - I was inspired after my trip to New York last month to change my talk at the last (responsible?</description>

      <description>So, following on from my observations of being an outsiderat FOSDEM because I&#39;m not an open source developer, I do have another story to tell where my female-ness is actually relevant.I&#39;m going to give specifics, but it&#39;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&#39;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. But I&#39;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.</description>

      <description>December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&#39;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&#39;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW!is a unique conference, in that it&#39;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.</description>

      <title>JAX London &amp; MongoDB Tutorial</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__mongodb_tutorial/</guid>
      <description>In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&amp;hellip;.
But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.</description>

      <description>So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blogthan a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&#39;d been to.So, JavaOne, again, my third year there. I&#39;ll always have a fondness for it - because of Martin Thompson, it was the first conference I presented at.</description>

      <title>Life on both sides of the interview table</title>

      <description>InfoQ has posted the video of Dan North and I opining on the subject of hiring. Most of the talk is spent on how to be a good interviewer, and touches on how to market your company to prospective hires. We spend less time on how to do well as an interviewee, but in theory if you know what&#39;s going through the interviewer&#39;s mind, you should be in a much better position to take control of the interview and shine.</description>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/my_summary_of_geecon_krakow/</guid>
      <description>Last week I was in Krakow, Poland for GeeCON. Which was excellent! I find it really interesting that conferences all have their own personalities, that they are not all the same.
From a speaker&#39;s point of view, there were some cultural things which took a bit of getting used to. One of the good things was that the audience was very keen on asking questions, they were much more interactive than a typical London audience (for example).</description>

      <description>So, despite promising myself that I would only do one event a month for the rest of this year, looks like I&#39;m going to be a bit busier than that.In case you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m up to (or, even better, hoping to see me talk or meet me), here are my confirmed engagements:15-17 May - GeeCon, Poland18-20 June - GOTO Amsterdam- whole day tutorial on the new (unfinished) MongoDB Java driver.</description>

      <description>Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.
Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&#39;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&#39;t do half as much as some people).</description>

      <description>I like QCon London, I really do. Not only is it on home turf, but, as I&#39;ve said before, it doesn&#39;t just focus on technology, or a set of technologies.Full disclosure: I&#39;ve been involved in planning QCon this year. So this time I know all the thinking, hard work, planning and last-minute changes that go into a conference like this. And it&#39;s a joy to be able to sit in the audience and see the conference that you&#39;ve helped build.</description>

      <description>As well as talking about, you know, actual work-type-stuff, I was encouraged to give my &amp;ldquo;Technical Approach to Women&amp;rdquo; presentation at Devoxx. This went so well at JavaOne that I thought it would be difficult to top. Also, I wasn&#39;t convinced it would work at Devoxx, because the theatres are not well suited to audience participation - the seats are warm and comfy, the room is dark, the speaker is on stage in front of a massive screen&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and got me excited about the prospects for 2013.The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&#39;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&#39;t expect to.</description>

      <description>Seemed like a quiet conference this year. Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&#39;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:A great keynote from Kirk Pepperdineand Martijn Verburg, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first nightA high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&#39;s interest, but it&#39;s more likely to be a one-off)A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by Mike BarkerAnd a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.</description>

      <description>Yesterday dawned, with a sense of foreboding (actually it dawned with me coughing my lungs out, but we&#39;ve heard enough about the sub-optimal state of my respiratory system this week). On this day, I was giving the talk I was dreadingwhen I got asked to do it. It&#39;s the talk I actually put more work into than any of the other sessions I was presenting at this JavaOne. It was the Women In IT talk.</description>

      <description>Well this is exciting! JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&#39;ve covered the same conference two years running. I think.It&#39;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. Last yearit was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchessfolk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&#39;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.</description>

      <description>Last week (was it only last week?) I was at Strange Loop, presenting a workshop on the Disruptor.I didn&#39;t really have any expectations from the conference, I&#39;ve never been before and, if I&#39;m honest, hadn&#39;t heard of it before. So everything was a pleasant surprise.It&#39;s a very geeky conference. I mean that as a compliment, of course. Lots of very smart people talking about stuff that&#39;s waaaay more advanced than you frequently get in the conferences employers would be happy to pay for.</description>

      <description>So yeah&amp;hellip; in keeping with this year&#39;s theme of basically only blogging about the exciting conferences I&#39;ve been to, I&#39;m going to blog about the exciting conferences I am attending in the future. I haven&#39;t been great at doing that, the disconnect between the time I submit a presentation and the actual announcement means that I often forget I haven&#39;t told anyone about what I&#39;m up to.Firstly, I&#39;m back in the States this month to present my very first workshop - An Introduction to the Disruptorat Strangeloop.</description>

      <description>So, my first day at my very first OSCON. I have to say that when Benand Martijntold me I hadto do OSCON, that it was one of theconferences to go to, I was sceptical - not because I thought it would be rubbish, but because I have enjoyed all the conferences I&#39;ve been to for different reasons.But I&#39;m really impressed so far.The programis packed with great topics and speakers, and so many things I want to see that clash with each other.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been challenged to do a session at a very large conference around women in programming. Which leads to two reactions from me 1) wow, what an honour! and 2) sigh.The problem with these sessions is that you&#39;re preaching to the choir. Those who turn up are a) women or b) men who are sympathetic and supportive to the cause. People who are actively discriminating against women or, more commonly, those who don&#39;t know their actions are hurting diversity in our industry, are the least likely to receive the message.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;User&#39;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; presentation I gave at QCon London is now available on the InfoQ site. This is the same presentation as the one I gave at Skillsmatter in March, but the questions are different. Plus since I&#39;m winging it every time, I probably cover slightly different things or explain some stuff better / worse.</description>

      <description>Three airports and three hotels in a week, and I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m coming or going. Add to that a mere four hours sleep last night, and this might resemble the ramblings of a mad woman (more than usual that is).GOTO Amsterdam was a different affair to GOTO Copenhagen, which is not necessarily a bad thing - it&#39;s great that the events have their own personalities and aren&#39;t cookie cutter versions of the same thing.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast, again to talk about all-female events. It&#39;s only a short one and there&#39;s probably not much in there that I haven&#39;t said before, either on here or in person.From the 21st May, I&#39;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. I&#39;ll be talking about code &amp;amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.</description>

I was interviewed at Sunday&#39;s Girl Geek conference, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again. For those who can&#39;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&#39;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.</description>

      <description>In theory, I am busy writing material for my upcoming speaking events, rather than writing terribly illuminatingposts on my blog (see what I did there?). In actuality I am being lazy and have pretty much taken January off for a recharge.In the spirit of doing something which ticks both the event-speaking and blogging boxes, this is a quick update on the conferences I&#39;m confirmed for so far. Put the following dates in your diary - these are my first international solo speaking events:7th March - QCon London - Concurrent Programming Using The Disruptor(sadly I can&#39;t stay for the whole conference as it clashes with the only holiday I had booked for 2012).</description>

      <description>At JAX London Mike and I presented &amp;ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&amp;rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.</description>

My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;.Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java CommunityOpen Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&#39;s near home and I helped to organise it. One of the awesome things about both Java Oneand Devoxxwas the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX Londonalong with a number of the London Java Communityregulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/ZoeI&#39;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginnerstalk that Mikeand I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities.</description>

But also I want to talk about JAX London from this week.But before I move on, it&#39;s probably worth rounding off with the last two resources from the conference.1) Martin Thompsonand I are interviewed about the Disruptor winning the Duke Award (we come in halfway through):2) I&#39;m interviewed by Duchessabout life, the universe and everything (well, the London Java Community, the JCP, the LMAX Disruptor and Duke Award, and women programmers).</description>

      <description>Having been back in London for a few days I&#39;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&#39;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):First and foremost, the people. I don&#39;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.</description>

      <description>So I&#39;ve been at JavaOne for the better part of three days, it&#39;s time to record some of my observations so far:The wireless access is rubbish.&amp;lt;Gross generalisation&amp;gt; technical people are not natural public speakers. Makes me feel better about the presentations I&#39;m going to be giving (see A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency).The sessions are less useful than getting out and chatting. I&#39;ve had a really excellent time, I&#39;ve met: people from other Java User Groups; the Duchessgirls; other Duke Award winners; the Azulguys; guys (well, girls) from O&#39;Reilly books; JCP members and many random and awesome people.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday I tagged along to the STAC London Summitto provide backup for Mike, who was on the &amp;ldquo;The Future of Messaging Middleware&amp;rdquo; panel.The panel consisted of two messaging providers, one hardware (Solace Systems) and one software (29West/Informatica), and two &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo;, Citihub and LMAX. Obviously both providers were arguing that theirs was the best solution. But what I found interesting is that I came away with the impression that everyone was really on the same side - everyone wants to use or to provide the best system, but there are different approaches.</description>

      <description>I attended TradeTech last week, an annual event about Equities and Derivatives trading. I assumed from the title that there would be a reasonable focus on technology, but I found it was more “Trade” and less “Tech”.The fascinating thing to me was how different this is from the sorts of technology conferences I&#39;ve been to. For example, I popped into JAXthis week (albeit in the evening for drinks). At technology conferences (&amp;lt;gross-generalisation&amp;gt;) people tend to subscribe to a variety of dress codes and fashion clans, usually from jeans through the range of business casual, including your fair share of goths and alternatives.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday I was fortunate enough to get a place on the FogBugz and Kiln World Tour. I booked it before I moved jobs, and I&#39;ll be honest I had no real interest in the software. I&#39;ve been reading Joel&#39;s books and blogs since my friend Brent bought me Joel on Softwareand made me read it (he had the foresight to know I&#39;d want to hang on to his copy if he&#39;d lent it to me!</description>
