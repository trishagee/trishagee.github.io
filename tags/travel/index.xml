      <description>I&#39;m going to be in Dublin 1st-5th July. While I&#39;m there, I thought I&#39;d visit appropriate user groups if there are any. I can&#39;t see a JUG registered on the JUG Map, but I was thinking a city like Dublin must have a few tech meetup groups.Any suggestions? Anyone out there and keen for me to gatecrash their party?</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;m off to JavaOnenext week!This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&#39;ll be there with Martin(of the Disruptorfame), and Martijn(that&#39;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&amp;hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJChe&#39;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committeerole.I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&#39;ll talk to me.</description>
