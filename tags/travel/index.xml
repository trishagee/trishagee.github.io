      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be in Dublin 1st-5th July. While I&amp;rsquo;m there, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d visit appropriate user groups if there are any. I can&amp;rsquo;t see a JUG registered on the JUG Map, but I was thinking a city like Dublin must have a few tech meetup groups.
Any suggestions? Anyone out there and keen for me to gatecrash their party?</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m off to JavaOne next week!
This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&amp;rsquo;ll be there with Martin (of the Disruptor fame), and Martijn (that&amp;rsquo;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&amp;hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJC he&amp;rsquo;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committee role.
I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&amp;rsquo;ll talk to me.</description>
