      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re a new speaker, or just starting to consider speaking at conferences or user groups 
for the first time, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to become overwhelmed by all the things you worry 
about when delivering a talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaker Tips - What to Wear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to cover it because I 
didn&amp;rsquo;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want other 
women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&amp;rsquo;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking
long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&amp;rsquo;s not how everyone works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I realise I have a bunch of experience and advice for speakers and potential speakers that I simply haven&amp;rsquo;t written down or shared. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first piece on things to consider that you might not have thought about.
Note: as usual, my advice is from the point of view of a woman (me) and is aimed mostly at women, but also as usual it&amp;rsquo;s probably useful for others to know too.</description>
