      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This July my Mum passed away, apparently cancer was the one opponent she couldn&amp;rsquo;t beat in an argument. Mum had a huge
impact on my life, as you might expect, not only personally but professionally too. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that some
more in time.  For now, I want to publish the poem my very talented cousin Izzi Giles wrote in tribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
