      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t see what an enormous impact Mum made on my life, because she was always there. There&amp;rsquo;s a quote in the book
Good Omens: &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s for the same reason you can&amp;rsquo;t see England when you&amp;rsquo;re in Trafalgar Square&amp;rdquo; - Mum was a constant,
important, dependable presence for my whole life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote something for Mum while I was on the plane from Spain to spend what was to be our last two weeks together.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some of that with you all now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This July my Mum passed away, apparently cancer was the one opponent she couldn&amp;rsquo;t beat in an argument. Mum had a huge
impact on my life, as you might expect, not only personally but professionally too. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that some
more in time.  For now, I want to publish the poem my very talented cousin Izzi Giles wrote in tribute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
