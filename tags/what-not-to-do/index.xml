      <description>Having experience Flaccid Scrum, I find this article interesting, and agree with most of it.
I&#39;d also like to add though, that if you do the scrum practices (story cards, stand ups, retrospectives, etc) but don&#39;t buy into the fundamental principals, you will not succeed. And that means everyone on the team, not just the people in charge. In particular, if the team is not empowered, is not committing to the estimates and the iteration plan in its heart, and and does not trust, then you are probably better off using traditional processes.</description>
