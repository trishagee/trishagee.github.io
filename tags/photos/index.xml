      <description>And now, a post for my long-neglected, less technical readers.
I took a week off in July to try and avoid that Oh My God I Missed Summer Again feeling. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get that in the UK even if you&amp;rsquo;re not stuck in an office the entire time.
Really this is just an excuse to post some photos on the blog.

If there are any girl programmers out there who are interested in being part of a montage showing who we are, I&amp;rsquo;d be dead (see what I did there&amp;hellip;?) interested in putting us all on one page. And not just because I&amp;rsquo;m narcissistic. Although that helps.</description>
