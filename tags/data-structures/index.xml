      <description>Recently we open sourced the LMAX Disruptor, the key to what makes our exchange so fast. Why did we open source it? Well, we&amp;rsquo;ve realised that conventional wisdom around high performance programming is&amp;hellip; a bit wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a better, faster way to share data between threads, and itÂ would be selfish not to share it with the world. Plus it makes us look dead clever.
On the site you can download a technical article explaining what the Disruptor is and why it&amp;rsquo;s so clever and fast.</description>
