      For years I&rsquo;ve avoided talking about the topic of what to wear when presenting. I didn&rsquo;t want to cover it because I didn&rsquo;t want people to think that I only worried about this topic because I was a woman. I also didn&rsquo;t want other women to inherit any of my neuroses around deciding what to wear. I&rsquo;m the sort of person who always enjoyed thinking long and hard about what to wear the next day at work, and I know that&rsquo;s not how everyone works.

      Now I&rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to present at a lot of conferences. Obviously all these conferences are mostly interested in my terribly educational talks, but it&rsquo;s also because I&rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&rsquo;t very many technical women speaking at conferences.
In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees.

      Last month at Devoxx I was in a session discussing what we can do to encourage more diversity in our speakers (specifically, although not limited to, increasing the number of women speakers).
I&rsquo;m going to outline the things I remember being discussed, although as usual we did not find the answer to the problem, only identify some issues and explore some options.
This is a very chaotic blog post, because if I don&rsquo;t post it now I&rsquo;ll never post it, and it&rsquo;s better if my thoughts are scrawled down and posted than if this all goes to die in my drafts folder.

I&rsquo;m going to give specifics, but it&rsquo;s not to name and shame or anything like that, it&rsquo;s just that anonymising it will probably erase some of the subtleties. &nbsp;But I&rsquo;m not telling this to make anyone feel bad, because this is not an oh-poor-me story, this is just the way it goes sometimes and I want to share what it feels like.

      Just a quick note to say I was interviewed for another podcast, again to talk about all-female events. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s only a short one and there&rsquo;s probably not much in there that I haven&rsquo;t said before, either on here or in person.
From the 21st May, I&rsquo;m at GOTO, both Copenhagen and Amsterdam. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be talking about code &amp; the Disruptor, thank goodness, and will be trying not to rant about the subject of women in technology.

      This week&rsquo;s BBC Outriders podcast features yours truly venting about The Subject That Won&rsquo;t Go Away, Women in Technology. &nbsp;I was interviewed at Sunday&rsquo;s Girl Geek conference, and got a chance to voice my opinions once again. &nbsp;For those who can&rsquo;t be bothered to listen, they can probably be summarised as:
There are genuine problems that face people in our industry, let&rsquo;s talk about those that you have actually faced, not ones that you imagine exist.

      Google Campus is an awesome spaceToday I was at the Girl Geek Meetup conference. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t advertise it much because I&rsquo;ve said in the past I don&rsquo;t really agree with women-only events, and actually I felt quite uncomfortable telling you guys I was going to be there, knowing the majority of my readers weren&rsquo;t allowed to attend.
It&rsquo;s probably worth explaining why I went, so a) I can give you guys and excuse but b) conference organisers can see what people like me are looking for in a conference.
