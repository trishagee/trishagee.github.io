      Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.

      December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.
I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW! is a unique conference, in that it&rsquo;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.

I&rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&rsquo;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&rsquo;t have a local user group to go to.

I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&rsquo;t really. For a start, you can&rsquo;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.

My slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&rsquo;t forget there&rsquo;s always my original blog posts (the Magic Ring Buffer, Reading from it, Writing to it, Wiring it up), which are now pretty dated, and the Java Magazine article I wrote at the start of the year.

      Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new community of developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.
It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&rsquo;d never given a presentation in a pub.

        JAX London - I learn stuff and meet people
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX London along with a number of the London Java Community regulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/Zoe I&rsquo;m looking at you&hellip;.)
My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners talk that Mike and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me.

      Remember a while back I talked about my first public appearance?
Well, I chased down the video, because I&rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&rsquo;t see me.

      I&rsquo;m finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I&rsquo;m going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk event, on the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. Ben and Martin&rsquo;s post gives a little more background on the subject.
Another LMAX LJC member Mike will also be giving a lightning talk, on Project Coin.
