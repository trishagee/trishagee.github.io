      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems 
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&#39;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&#39;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant, 
mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example, 
where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&#39;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&#39;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

      <title>Sevilla MUG March Madness</title>

      <description>Last night the Sevilla MUG had our March Madness event. This was our largest event yet, with 36 people signed up. Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month, that&#39;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&#39;t the main attraction - [Javier] (https://twitter.com/JvrBaena) gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at SocialBro after using MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.</description>

      <description>December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&#39;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&#39;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.I cannot take Christmas seriously in this weatherYOW!is a unique conference, in that it&#39;s the same agenda in three different cities: Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney.</description>

      <title>First presentation at the Virtual JUG!</title>

      <description>Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for vJUG, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&#39;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&#39;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&#39;t normally go to conferences or don&#39;t have a local user group to go to.</description>

      <description>So, I thought a few months ago that my blog would become more of a travel blogthan a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&#39;d been to.So, JavaOne, again, my third year there. I&#39;ll always have a fondness for it - because of Martin Thompson, it was the first conference I presented at.</description>

      <description>Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.
Of course, disclaimers first - I was on the programme committee, so I might say that the whole thing was awesome. Although in all honesty, even being slightly involved in the organisation of a conference is a lot of work, and you can&#39;t wait to see the back of it (and I didn&#39;t do half as much as some people).</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the nerve-wrackingdubiousalarminggreat pleasure of presenting my first official MongoDB-shaped talk. This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.I naïvely assumed it would be like a presentation but without the visible hand-waving, but it isn&#39;t really. For a start, you can&#39;t easily poll the audience to find out what their level of experience is, and taking questions is quite tricky, even with the technology to support it.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve produced a very cut down version of the presentation I&#39;ve been giving at a lot of conferences, giving a high level overview to the Disruptor. This serves as a quick intro to the concepts behind it.Introduction to the Disruptorfrom Trisha GeeMy slides are usually pretty useless without me (or someone else) talking over them, so for more context don&#39;t forget there&#39;s always my original blog posts (the Magic Ring Buffer, Reading from it, Writing to it, Wiring it up), which are now pretty dated, and the Java Magazinearticle I wrote at the start of the year.</description>

      <description>Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new communityof developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&#39;d never given a presentation in a pub.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a video of my Open Conference session on the business benefits of open sourcing your software. Given that the conference was at a weekend and had a very intimate feel, I think I was a teeny bit more honest than I usually am.

      <description>A few weeks ago, I presented my new &amp;ldquo;User&#39;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; talk to the London Java Community. Since it was very kindly hosted at Skillsmatter, there is a video of the presentationavailable, and the slides are below.Concurrent Programming Using the DisruptorView more presentationsfrom Trisha GeeThe presentation is a little different to the ones we&#39;ve done before. Previously we&#39;ve gone into how it works and why it&#39;s fast. This time I wanted to step back a little from the internals and show how real developers might actually use it.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX Londonalong with a number of the London Java Communityregulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/ZoeI&#39;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginnerstalk that Mikeand I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I&#39;m going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk event, on the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. Ben and Martin&#39;s postgives a little more background on the subject.Another LMAXLJC member Mikewill also be giving a lightning talk, on Project Coin.</description>
