      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I gave a keynote at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/berlin-2014/presentation/Party%20Keynote:%20Staying%20Ahead%20of%20the%20Curve&#34;&gt;GOTO Berlin&lt;/a&gt; to address the problems
of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant, mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example, where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;, with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since I have a tendency to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at GOTO Aarhus, a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated you on my travel plans, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve had some more conferences confirmed,
I thought I would pass the information on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sevilla MUG March Madness</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/svq_mug_march_madness/</link>

      <description>Last night the Sevilla MUG had our March Madness event. This was our largest event yet, with 36 people signed up. Although the aim of March Madness is to have a MongoDB Engineer at all the user groups this month, that&amp;rsquo;s not such a big deal for us as I live here, so this was also the first event where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main attraction - [Javier] (https://twitter.com/JvrBaena) gave a really great talk about the lessons learnt at SocialBro after using MongoDB in production for the last couple of years.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been running into &lt;a href=&#34;https://corporate.sky.com/&#34;&gt;BSkyB&lt;/a&gt; a bunch this week - firstly I was invited to kick off their innovation tech talks series last Monday, then I kept meeting Sky people (that makes it sound like they’re aliens) at &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconlondon.com/&#34;&gt;QCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;December disappeared in a rush of vacation and a fleeting tour of Australia. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s the eve of Christmas Eve already, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to feel Christmassy when you&amp;rsquo;re getting sunburnt on a boat and seeing people in swim-suits wearing santa hats. A mid-winter festival (complete with trees and fake snow) just feels very odd in summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First presentation at the Virtual JUG!</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/first_presentation_at_the_virtual_jug/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/first_presentation_at_the_virtual_jug/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/&#34;&gt;vJUG&lt;/a&gt;, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&amp;rsquo;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&amp;rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&amp;rsquo;t have a local user group to go to. Not to mention cutting travel costs and saving the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I thought a few months ago that my blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2013/09/16/javazone_oslo/&#34;&gt;would become more of a travel blog&lt;/a&gt; than a tech blog because of the amount of conferences I was going to. Turned out that I was so busy writing / updating / practicing talks and workshops and, er, travelling, that I never got around to doing retrospectives on the events I&amp;rsquo;d been to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was the first Devoxx UK, bringing the brand from Belgium and, more recently, France. And I think it was a HUGE success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the &lt;strike&gt;nerve-wracking&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;dubious&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;alarming&lt;/strike&gt; great pleasure of presenting my first official &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mongodb.org/&#34;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;-shaped talk. This was in the form of a webinar, which is an interesting and different format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve produced a very cut down version of the presentation I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving at a lot of conferences, giving a high level overview to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lmax-exchange.github.com/disruptor/&#34;&gt;Disruptor&lt;/a&gt;. This serves as a quick intro to the concepts behind it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to &lt;a href=&#34;http://010dev.nl/post/social-tech-event-the-disruptor-and-the-perfect-programmer&#34;&gt;present to a brand new community&lt;/a&gt; of developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Open Source Your Secrets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of my Open Conference session on the business benefits of open sourcing your software. Given that the conference was at a weekend and had a very intimate feel, I think I was a teeny bit more honest than I usually am. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I presented my new &amp;ldquo;User&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; talk to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt;. Since it was very kindly hosted at Skillsmatter, there is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/the-disruptor/js-3798&#34;&gt;video of the presentation&lt;/a&gt; available, and the slides are below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JAX London - I learn stuff and meet people</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__i_learn_stuff_and_meet_people/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/jax_london__i_learn_stuff_and_meet_people/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I was at &lt;a href=&#34;http://jaxlondon.com/&#34;&gt;JAX London&lt;/a&gt; along with a number of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/&#34;&gt;London Java Community&lt;/a&gt; regulars (&lt;a href=&#34;http://martijnverburg.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Martijn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/kittylyst&#34;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://jr0cket.com/&#34;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/members/5737653/&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://devangelist.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;http://zoah.co.uk/jax-london&#34;&gt;Zoe&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My purpose for attending was largely to present the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.com/2011/10/21/mike_and_i_debut_our_new_disruptor_presentation/&#34;&gt;Hardcore Concurrency for Beginners&lt;/a&gt; talk that &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First public appearance caught on video</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/post/first_public_appearance_caught_on_video/</guid>
      <description>Remember a while back I talked about my first public appearance?
Well, I chased down the video, because I&amp;rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&amp;rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&amp;rsquo;t see me.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk event, on the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. Ben and Martin&amp;rsquo;s post gives a little more background on the subject.
Another LMAX LJC member Mike will also be giving a lightning talk, on Project Coin.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For blatant self-publicity, I&amp;rsquo;m making a note of all the presentations, panels, interviews, articles and other public-facing events I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in. This is a non-exhaustive list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
