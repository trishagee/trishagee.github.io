      <description>You know how I keep banging on about attracting different types of people into programming? You know how we say we need to get them young?
Typical Mathematician?A little while back I decided to put my money where my mouth was, so I signed up to be a STEM Ambassador. STEMNET is an organisation that aims to inspire children to go into Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths careers, and it does this by creating a network of mentors (people like you and me) and schools.</description>

      <description>So yet another interview with me is available, but this one is in written form. It&amp;rsquo;s for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.
It&amp;rsquo;s long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it.</description>
