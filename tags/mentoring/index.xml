      <description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&#34;http://careers.grad-dc.co.uk/2012/05/18/107/&#34;&gt;yet another interview&lt;/a&gt; with me is available, but this one is in written form.  It&amp;rsquo;s for the Graduate Developer Community, the aim is to show undergraduates and graduates what real techies jobs are like, and how people doing them they got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s long, but if you know anyone just starting out their career who wants to get a feel for where they might want to go, please point them at it.  The site has a number of interviews with people in different roles so it&amp;rsquo;s quite a good way to showcase the diversity of what&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Update: 15 Dec 2020: Original article doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be around any more, so I&amp;rsquo;ve reproduced the content here)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
