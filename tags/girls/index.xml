      <description>Let&#39;s celebrate our IT women
&amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; knows that there are more men than women in IT. That it&#39;s a &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; job. Not a lot of people know that the first programmer was a woman. Not a lot of people realise the number of women in IT is DECREASING. And has been since the 80s. In a working world where I honestly believe that in general there are more opportunities for women (OK, inline with the other stuff I&#39;ve been reading I&#39;ll caveat this with white, middle-class women), it seems shocking that such a growth industry as IT is actually losing women, and appears unable to determine why, or stop the flow.</description>
