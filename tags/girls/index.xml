      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate our IT women
&amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; knows that there are more men than women in IT.&amp;nbsp; That it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;quot;boys&amp;quot; job. &amp;nbsp;Not a lot of people know that the first programmer was a woman.&amp;nbsp; Not a lot of people realise the number of women in IT is DECREASING. &amp;nbsp;And has been since the 80s. &amp;nbsp;In a working world where I&amp;nbsp;honestly believe that in general there are more opportunities for women&amp;nbsp;(OK, inline with the other stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading I&amp;rsquo;ll caveat this with white, middle-class women), it seems shocking that such a growth industry as IT&amp;nbsp;is actually losing women, and appears unable to determine why, or stop the flow.</description>
