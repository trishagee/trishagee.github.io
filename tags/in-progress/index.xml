      <description>Things I took out of QCon:
I want to play with Ajax.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I&#39;ve &#34;grown out&#34; of front end development but that doesn&#39;t prevent it from being (potentially) extremely coolSelenium looks like a good place to start for automated website testingIt can take up to 7 years to move away from a legacy architecture.&amp;nbsp; Depressing, but at least it shows it can be done and it&#39;s worth the effortI&#39;m going to become a certified Scrum Master Mistress.</description>
