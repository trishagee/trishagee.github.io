      <description>I know there are arguments against certification, and I definitely think that using certifictionto determine whether to interview or recruit people is downright daft, because frankly learning a bunch of answers isn&#39;t all that difficult. But I personally find that completing a certification really helps to round out my knowledge in an area. I guess my thoughts are that a fairly recent certification combined with the work experience to back it up is something that would make your CV more interesting to recruiters.</description>
