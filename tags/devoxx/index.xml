      <description>If you see anything about LMAX- the Disruptor, Continuous Delivery, or even the selection criteria for hiring developers, you&#39;ll see that LMAX is pretty keen on Agile. However, no-one&#39;s documented the Agile process there, as far as I know. Although I personally had it on my todo list, I never had the motivation, the hook to do it. And I realised eventually that&#39;s because I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a process that would work very well for another team, in another company, working in another business.</description>

      <description>Tori Wieldt from the Oracle Technology Network interviewed me at Devoxx. Because I was there to be on the Why We Shouldn&#39;t Target Womenpanel, the interview is just another platform for me to air my views on this subject again. Yes, I am actually wearing pink&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m back from Devoxx, having had lots of food for thought. In particular, my panel on Why We Shouldn&#39;t Target Womengenerated a lot of discussion and I&#39;m still trying to process it all.Martijn Verburg; Regina ten Bruggencate; Trisha Gee; Antonio Goncalves; Claude Falguière; Kim Ross The panel went really well, we got decent interaction from the audience, and of course my fellow panel members were awesome. I managed to restrain myself from using the opportunity as my own personal soap box and allowed other people to speak occasionally.</description>
