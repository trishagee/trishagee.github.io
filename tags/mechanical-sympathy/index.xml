      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets talk about mechanical sympathy. Martin Thompson has been making this term very popular in software development, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to read &lt;a href=&#34;http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/why-mechanical-sympathy.html&#34;&gt;his description of why he used the term&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>My recent slow-down in posting is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to write a post explaining memory barriers and their applicability in the Disruptor. The problem is, no matter how much I read and no matter how many times I ask the ever-patient Martin and Mike questions trying to clarify some point, I just don&amp;rsquo;t intuitively grasp the subject. I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t have the deep background knowledge required to fully understand.</description>

      <description>We mention the phrase Mechanical Sympathy quite a lot, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s even Martin&amp;rsquo;s blog title. It&amp;rsquo;s about understanding how the underlying hardware operates and programming in a way that works with that, not against it.
We get a number of comments and questions about the mysterious cache line padding in the RingBuffer, and I referred to it in the last post. Since this lends itself to pretty pictures, it&amp;rsquo;s the next thing I thought I would tackle.</description>
