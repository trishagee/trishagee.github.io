      <description>You may have noticed that the more I go to conferences, the less I write about them. I could claim lack of time, but the fact is that all my write-ups will be something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Loved &amp;lt;city&amp;gt;, went to talks that made me think, met interesting people, gave a talk or two that seemed to go well&amp;rdquo;. Not sure if people get bored of reading that, but I get bored of writing it.</description>

      <description>Because I was missing coding, and because my friend and I had an awesome phone app idea at the weekend, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try my hand at developing an Android application this week.
I want to give a quick overview of my preliminary thoughts on getting started on this endeavour. Background: I&amp;rsquo;ve got more than 10 years Java experience, but any UI for the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on was always a web UI.</description>
