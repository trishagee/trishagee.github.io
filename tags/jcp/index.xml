      <description>Having been back in London for a few days I&amp;rsquo;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.
My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):

      <description>Remember a while back I talked about my first public appearance?
Well, I chased down the video, because I&amp;rsquo;m masochistic, and here it is for you all to enjoy. Pleasingly my mannerisms are slightly less of a camp man trapped in a woman&amp;rsquo;s body, which was my impression the last time I saw myself presenting. It helps that YouTube has made the video so dark you can&amp;rsquo;t see me.</description>
