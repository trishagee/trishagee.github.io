      <description>Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don&#39;t Think I Agree With.To developers technologies are everythingI can&#39;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.Is this true?It&#39;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.</description>

      <description>Gah!! This is exactlywhat I was talking about- it&#39;s pink, it mentions shoes, and it&#39;s about as patronising as you can get.Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Linus Torvalds? I bet for a start it wouldn&#39;t mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags. And it probably wouldn&#39;t be in baby blue either.Which leads me nicely onto the next subject I have strong opinions on: Role models.</description>
