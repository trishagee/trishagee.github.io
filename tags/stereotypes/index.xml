      <description>I attended (one way or another) two events last week that got me thinkingThe first was&amp;nbsp;Girl Developers will Save the World&amp;nbsp;- a session that had me a little confused as to whether that referred to me, or&amp;nbsp;actual&amp;nbsp;girls, i.e. those that are not yet legally classed as adults.&amp;nbsp; The second was the&amp;nbsp;Remarkable Women Twitter&amp;nbsp;party the following day.Firstly, a caveat/disclaimer (as usual) - both events were useful, thought-provoking and overall worthwhile.&amp;nbsp; But the alarming thing to me was the number of times I heard &#34;</description>

      <description>Continuing the theme of Things I Have Heard I Don&amp;rsquo;t Think I Agree With.
To developers technologies are everything
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the context of this but I hear the same sentiment in different guises over and over again. Often from non-techies, but more alarmingly from developers.
Is this true?
It&amp;rsquo;s true for a certain tribe of techies, sure. And creating and effectively using new technologies is an important part of what drives the current information age forward.</description>

      <description>Gah!! This is exactly what I was talking about - it&amp;rsquo;s pink, it mentions shoes, and it&amp;rsquo;s about as patronising as you can get.
Would the chart be different if your possible outcomes were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Linus Torvalds? I bet for a start it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mention Jimmy Choos or choice of handbags. And it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in baby blue either.
Which leads me nicely onto the next subject I have strong opinions on: Role models.</description>
