      <description>&lt;p&gt;And now, a post for my long-neglected, less technical readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a week off in July to try and avoid that Oh My God I Missed Summer Again feeling. Granted, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get that in the UK even if you&amp;rsquo;re not stuck in an office the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really this is just an excuse to post some photos on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living and working in central London, you quickly learn that the fastest way around town is to cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My extensive research into this activity has shown there are a number of different cycling tribes. Of course, I have split them into the two groups that are most appropriate to me: 1) slower than me and 2) faster than me. You can probably tell what sort of a cyclist I am by my attitude to the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
