Background context&amp;nbsp;
Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you.</description>

      <description>When I first started playing with Java 1.5, I thought generics were the best thing since sliced bread. No more untidy casting, lovely type-safe Collections, and when combined with the new for loop, a lot of the tedious tasks associated with Collections became easier and, most importantly, aesthetically pleasing.Consider the old code: List list = new ArrayList(); list.add(new Integer(1)); Integer integer = (Integer)list.get(0); for (Iterator i = list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) { Integer number = (Integer)i.</description>
