      <description>Lets talk about mechanical sympathy. Martin Thompson has been making this term very popular in software development, so it&#39;s best to read his description of why he used the term.I had a perfect example yesterday. I&#39;m about to drive to the airport and the car won&#39;t move (I&#39;m a modern tomboy, I can write stories about hair and stories about cars). Not at all. It&#39;s stuck. I can&#39;t reverse out of my parking space.</description>
