      <title>What Can Conferences Do To Attract More Women Speakers?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve been speaking at (mostly Java) conferences for a while (six years now), I get asked to 
present at a lot of conferences.  &lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt; all these conferences are mostly interested in my 
terribly educational talks, but it&amp;rsquo;s also because I&amp;rsquo;m a technical woman and there aren&amp;rsquo;t very 
many technical women speaking at conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, conferences want to do the right thing - they want a diverse line up of 
speakers, they want to attract diverse attendees. Often this is not as easy as it may seem, and 
frequently conferences are Twitter-shamed for not having enough women speakers. When it gets to 
this point (and often before), conferences frequently ask me for advice on 
speakers they could invite, and how to attract more women.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
