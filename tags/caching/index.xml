      <description>Today I would like to document my experiences implementing caching with Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) and annotations.&amp;nbsp;

Background context&amp;nbsp;
Caching may need to be implemented in your application for a number of reasons. OK, actually usually only one: performance. I would like to add my own tuppence-worth to this though - if you can get away without caching (specifically in application that provide the ability to view and change data) then do so, unless you are using a cache implementation that will handle as much of the pain as possible for you.</description>
