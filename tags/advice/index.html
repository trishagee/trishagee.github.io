      Hmm. I have been so busy trying to think of &ldquo;good&rdquo; things to write here, and not having the time to actually write, that I see it&rsquo;s been 6 months since the last post.If anyone is still out there though, I need help. I need a good Certified Scrum Master course in New York or London, preferably in April or May. Any suggestions? The one I wanted to go on was vetoed and now I find it&rsquo;s not running in NY again until Autumn.
