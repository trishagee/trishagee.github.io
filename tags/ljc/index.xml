      <title>JAX London &amp; MongoDB Tutorial</title>

      <description>In previous years, JAX London would have been an easy, local conference to go to. This time it took me most of Sunday to get there, and not because of the Super Storm. Still, that gave me the day to finish off the tutorial I was running there on Monday morning. Not that I would be so unprofessional as to leave preparing things until the last minute, oh no&amp;hellip;.
But as in previous years, the main benefit of this conference for me was meeting most of the usual suspects from the London Java Community.</description>

      <description>Saturday I had the pleasure of being part of the 5th London Java Community Open Conference. This is a great event to end the conference season on - it made me feel good about being part of the LJC, and got me excited about the prospects for 2013.The fantastic thing about an open conference is that a) you don&#39;t have to prepare like mad for it and b) the short sessions and wide variety of subjects mean that you learn stuff you didn&#39;t expect to.</description>

      <title>NightHacking Tour: The LJC</title>

      <description>On the same day Stephen Chin came to see meat the 10gen offices, we also ran a NightHacking session in the evening with the London Java Community. Not many people turned up (maybe I need to work on my signage to the office?) but it was a great session. In fact, having less people meant we could all be involved.Expect Raspberry Pis and JavaFX.</description>

      <description>Seemed like a quiet conference this year. Not really sure why, maybe it was the layout of the massive (and extremely dark) main room; maybe it was the awkward L-shape of the communal space; or maybe this year people were more interested in listening to the (really very good) sessions rather than participating or meeting other people. Whatever the reason, it felt quiet and almost low-key.Performance seemed pretty high on the agenda, as you&#39;d expect from a London conference, with a number of things on offer:A great keynote from Kirk Pepperdineand Martijn Verburg, covering a massive range of things to care about when thinking about performance on the first nightA high-level talk about Java Performance from yours truly (which I may run again for the LJC if there&#39;s interest, but it&#39;s more likely to be a one-off)A deep dive into writing lock-free coding by Mike BarkerAnd a talk from Kirk exploring your GC logs.</description>

      <description>Well this is exciting! JavaOne 2011 is the first conference I spoke at, so this the first time I&#39;ve covered the same conference two years running. I think.It&#39;s very nice to be back at JavaOne. Last yearit was my first opportunity to meet so many people - the guys at Oracle who work really hard to make sure Java has its own identity; the JUG Leaders and Duchessfolk; the JCP EC committee members; and loads of people who live and work in the area who I wouldn&#39;t normally get a chance to speak to in person.</description>

      <description>I was interviewed at GOTO Copenhagen, about Java, the Disruptor, the Graduate Developer Community &amp;amp; London Java Community, and a whole host of other things. So to make up for the lack of blogging this month, here it is:</description>

      <description>Topping off my mini-tour at the end of May, I was invited to Rotterdam to present to a brand new communityof developers. I was really interested in attending because my experience with user groups is pretty much limited to the London Java Community, and I knew this would be different due to being a) across a wider range of technologies and b) shiny and new.It was hosted (rather awesomely) in a brewery, and until then I&#39;d never given a presentation in a pub.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I presented my new &amp;ldquo;User&#39;s Guide to the Disruptor&amp;rdquo; talk to the London Java Community. Since it was very kindly hosted at Skillsmatter, there is a video of the presentationavailable, and the slides are below.Concurrent Programming Using the DisruptorView more presentationsfrom Trisha GeeThe presentation is a little different to the ones we&#39;ve done before. Previously we&#39;ve gone into how it works and why it&#39;s fast. This time I wanted to step back a little from the internals and show how real developers might actually use it.</description>

      <description>Saturday was, hopefully, my last conference of the year. My lucky readers should start to see some posts which are not simply me gushing about another opportunity to hang out with awesome people and learn about interesting &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;.Who wants to propose a session?In many ways the London Java CommunityOpen Conference was my favourite one so far, and not just because it&#39;s near home and I helped to organise it. One of the awesome things about both Java Oneand Devoxxwas the opportunity to travel, to see new places and to meet people you might not meet in London.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I was at JAX Londonalong with a number of the London Java Communityregulars (Martijn/Ben/John/Sandro/Simon/ZoeI&#39;m looking at you&amp;hellip;.)My purpose for attending was largely to present the Hardcore Concurrency for Beginnerstalk that Mikeand I debuted at an LJC event a few weeks back. Almost as important was catching up with the aforementioned LJCers and meeting with as many people as would talk to me. After the disappointment of the sessions at Java One, sitting in a room being talked at was quite low down on my list of priorities.</description>

      <description>Last Tuesday Mikeand I unveiled our brand shiny new presentation: Understanding the Disruptor, a Beginner&#39;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency. This was a preview of the talk we&#39;ll be doing at JAX Londonon the 2nd November.A video of the sessionis available, as are the slides. I promise not to say &amp;ldquo;so&amp;rdquo; anywhere near as many times when I repeat my performance at JAX (is there anything more painful than watching yourself on video?</description>

      <description>Having been back in London for a few days I&#39;ve had some time to digest the madness that was last week.My lasting impression of JavaOne is almost entirely positive. Granted, it was my first major conference, so maybe I&#39;m just not jaded yet. But let me tell you what I loved about it (yes, I did cover some of these in my last post):First and foremost, the people. I don&#39;t remember meeting a single grumpy person.</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;m off to JavaOnenext week!This is an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. I&#39;ll be there with Martin(of the Disruptorfame), and Martijn(that&#39;s not going to get confusing at all). Martin will be talking about the Disruptor on Thursday, and Martijn is busy talking about&amp;hellip; everything. Most importantly for the LJChe&#39;s representing us in our shiny new JCP Executive Committeerole.I&#39;m really looking forward to meeting pretty much anyone and everyone who&#39;ll talk to me.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m finally moving up from working behind the scenes to actually doing a (short) presentation for the LJC. I&#39;m going to be giving a lightning talk on Wednesday at the AWS Elastic Beanstalk event, on the JCP - what it is and what our election to the executive committee means. Ben and Martin&#39;s postgives a little more background on the subject.Another LMAXLJC member Mikewill also be giving a lightning talk, on Project Coin.</description>

      <description>As an associate member of the London Java Community(LJC), I&#39;m very pleased with the news that we won an Open seat on the Java SE/EE executive committee. The resultsshow that we got an astonishing 47.5% of the vote - if an MP got voted in with that percentage the newspapers would probably be using the word &amp;ldquo;landslide&amp;rdquo;.It&#39;s quite exciting to be one of the two user groups involved. We hope to balance some of the larger corporate organisations, we&#39;re the voice of real life Java developers who use the language every day, for enterprise development or open source projects.</description>
