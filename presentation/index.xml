      <description>&lt;p&gt;New versions of Java are coming out every 6 months now. What has changed, should we upgrade, and if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the list in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/public_appearances/&#34;&gt;talks section&lt;/a&gt; of my blog covers past presentations, 
this page should list my confirmed upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not planning to travel anywhere for 2020 at this time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>News from IntelliJ IDEA Community</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/fosdem_2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video and resources for the Update on IntelliJ IDEA talk from FOSDEM 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With releases of Java coming thick and fast every six months, it&amp;rsquo;s a full time job staying on top of the features. If
your IDE can help you here, it&amp;rsquo;s one less thing to worry about. IntelliJ IDEA Community has three releases every
year, each one improves the support for modern versions of Java, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing on offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join this session to see what&amp;rsquo;s new in IntelliJ IDEA Community (the free one!). This is not limited to just
supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things
developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well
and good, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not usable those features mean nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page contains my bio, a link to a photo, and a selection of talk titles and abstracts. For conferences that are
interested in having me present, these are generally the talks you might want to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fully Reactive: Spring, Kotlin, and JavaFX Playing Together</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/coding_duel/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/coding_duel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spring Framework 5 brings full reactive support to developers everywhere. What better way to demo reactive
programming than to actually build something live? Trisha will live code an end-to-end application using Spring
Framework 5, Spring Boot, Reactor, Kotlin, JavaFX, and maybe even some MongoDB, all built using IntelliJ IDEA. 
During this session, we’ll see how these different components can work together really easily using Spring. What
could possibly go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken at JavaOne (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016) and have received the JavaOne Rock Star award several times. I&amp;rsquo;ve presented many times at QCon London, and other notable conferences include QCon New York, Devoxx BE and UK, JavaZone, CraftConf OSCON and various GOTO conferences. I also regularly present to user groups around the world, and am a leader of the Sevilla Java User Group.

      <description>It’s 2018, and we still
 Have conferences with only one woman speaker Regularly see all-male panels See only a small subset of ethnicities represented Use language that excludes people from job advertisements  By now we’ve heard that diversity makes for better teams, better products, and better leadership, and it seems like the industry has been beating itself up about it for some time now. Why isn’t it fixed? What can we do?</description>

      <title>Code Review Best Practices</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/code_review_best_practice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Updated 23 July, 2020)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We know that Code Reviews are a Good Thing. We probably have our own personal lists of things we
look for in the code we review, while also fearing what others might say about our code. How to 
we ensure that code reviews are actually benefiting the team, and the application? How do we 
decide who does the reviews? What does &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this talk, Trisha will identify some best practices to follow. She&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what&amp;rsquo;s 
really important in a code review, and set out some guidelines to follow in order to maximise the
value of the code review and minimise the pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation is about how to change a team&amp;rsquo;s attitude towards writing automated tests.  The 
talk covers the same case study as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/groovy_vs_java&#34;&gt;Groovy vs Java for Testing&lt;/a&gt;, adopting 
Spock in MongoDB, but this is a more process/agile/people perspective, not a
technical look at the merits of one language over another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content and resources for the Java 8 in Anger presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vJUG video of Java 8 in Anger shows the Java 8 version of this talk in 
its clearest form. Here I also have links to other material I&amp;rsquo;ve published 
on this topic, and to the resources I used to create the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 this talk has evolved to also contain some Java 9 features too, and 
the latest version even shows how to use TDD to help figure out which stream 
operations you need. The video of the latest version is not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant, 
mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example, 
where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving, 
which happens to be the same one I&amp;rsquo;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&amp;rsquo;m evolving it as I go along).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at [GOTO Aarhus](http://gotocon .com/video#36), a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for vJUG, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&amp;rsquo;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&amp;rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&amp;rsquo;t have a local user group to go to.</description>

In this video I talk about going to Mars, education, planning your career, being a developer, and the impact of technology on our lives. So, not much&amp;hellip;

      <description>At JAX London Mike and I presented &amp;ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&amp;rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For blatant self-publicity, I&amp;rsquo;m making a note of all the presentations, panels, interviews, articles and other public-facing events I&amp;rsquo;ve
been involved in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
