      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the list in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/public_appearances/&#34;&gt;talks section&lt;/a&gt; of my blog covers past presentations,
this page should list my confirmed upcoming events.

      <title>Is boilerplate code really so bad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting staying up to date with the evolution of Java and the myriad other JVM languages.  Is it worth it? What
do modern languages give us?

      <title>Level Up Your Automated Tests</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/level_up_your_automated_tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation is about how to change a team&amp;rsquo;s attitude towards writing automated tests.  The
talk covers the same case study as
&lt;a href=&#34;https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/groovy_vs_java&#34;&gt;Groovy vs Java for Testing&lt;/a&gt;, adopting
Spock in MongoDB, but this is a more process/agile/people perspective, not a
technical look at the merits of one language over another.

      <title>Java 8 in Anger</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/java8_in_anger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content and resources for the Java 8 in Anger presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vJUG video of Java 8 in Anger shows the Java 8 version of this talk in
its clearest form. Here I also have links to other material I&amp;rsquo;ve published
on this topic, and to the resources I used to create the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 this talk has evolved to also contain some Java 9 features too, and
the latest version even shows how to use TDD to help figure out which stream
operations you need. The video of the latest version is not yet available.

of deciding how to learn a new technology/framework/process (Spoiler Alert: it&amp;rsquo;s not by putting it into production).

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving an evolving live demonstration of coding a Fully Buzz Word Compliant,
mobile-friendly web application.  The aim of the demo is to show, via a real-world application rather than snippets or a toy example,
where these popular technologies sit in your architecture, and how they interact with each other.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;http://gotocon.com/chicago-2014/&#34;&gt;GOTO Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, I was given the chance to chat a bit about the presentation I was giving,
which happens to be the same one I&amp;rsquo;m giving at a number of conferences this year (although of course I&amp;rsquo;m evolving it as I go along).

      <title>What do you mean, Backwards Compatibility? (YOW 2013)</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/yow_2013_backwards/</link>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/yow_2013_backwards/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;YOW recorded me, yet again, talking about the adventure that is the design of the new Java Driver for MongoDB.  This is the same talk I
gave at &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/72982916&#34;&gt;GeeCON&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.parleys.com/play/51c325c3e4b0d38b54f4624f/chapter1/about&#34;&gt;DevoxxUK&lt;/a&gt;,
with some updates based on our Journey So Far.  In it, I cover the architecture of the new driver and some of our current thoughts
around where we want the API to go.

      <title>Career Advice for Programmers (YOW 2013)</title>

      <description>Since I have a tendancy to bang on every now and again about how we, as developers, could do better in managing our careers (for example, by creating CVs that don&amp;rsquo;t suck, and by staying ahead of the curve), Dave Thomas asked me to speak for a mere 50 minutes on the subject at GOTO Aarhus, a talk I wasn&amp;rsquo;t enormously happy with as there was no way to cover a lifetime of hard-fought experience in such a short time.</description>

I think he brings out the best in me.

      <title>First presentation at the Virtual JUG!</title>

      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/first_presentation_at_the_virtual_jug/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday I had the privilege of presenting the very first session for vJUG, a new virtual Java User Group that allows us to span geographies when sharing talks and stories. I&amp;rsquo;m really interested in the vJUG idea, especially now I&amp;rsquo;m not in London - if we can find good ways to share knowledge without having to travel, that will help us reach people who don&amp;rsquo;t normally go to conferences or don&amp;rsquo;t have a local user group to go to.</description>

      <description>I was flattered a couple of weeks ago to be interviewed by Google as part of their women techmaker&amp;rsquo;s series, as it moves over to Europe. In this video I talk about going to Mars, education, planning your career, being a developer, and the impact of technology on our lives. So, not much&amp;hellip;

      <description>I was flattered to be interviewed for InfoQ at QCon London. It was a fun interview actually, and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything like the half an hour it actually took. In it, I get to talk about Agile at LMAX, the Disruptor (of course) and diversity in IT (again).</description>

      <title>Video of our JAX London session</title>
      <link>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://trishagee.github.io/presentation/video_of_our_jax_london_session/</guid>
      <description>At JAX London Mike and I presented &amp;ldquo;Understanding the Disruptor - A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Hardcore Concurrency&amp;rdquo;. This is the session we initially previewed to the London Java Community a few weeks earlier. The content is the same, but the feel of the presentation was quite different to us - the venue for the LJC event was more intimate, and it was easier to interact with the audience. At JAX, we were up on stage, which was pretty cool actually, but meant that it felt more like a lecture and it was less easy to connect with the audience.</description>
